View information on every USAA sponsored cat bond here.The insurer has established a new Cayman Islands based special purpose vehicle, Residential Reinsurance 2023 Limited for its cat bonds this year.Residential Reinsurance 2023 Limited will look to issue two tranches of Series 2023-1 notes, that will be sold to investors and the proceeds used to collateralize underlying reinsurance agreements between the vehicle and USAA.The two tranches will provide USAA with annual aggregate reinsurance protection against losses from the perils of U.S. tropical cyclones, earthquakes (plus fire following), severe thunderstorm, winter storm, wildfire, volcanic eruption, meteorite impact, other perils (all including auto & renter policy flood losses).This is the same group of perils covered by all of USAA’s multi-peril cat bonds for some years now.The reinsurance protection will run across annual risk periods though a four-year term, beginning June 2023 and running to the end of May 2027, we understand.Both tranches of notes will feature an indemnity trigger and their provide annual aggregate coverage after an initial event deductible of $50 million is applied, to qualify catastrophes under the terms of the cat bond deal, we’re told.A tranche of Class 13 notes have a preliminary size of $75 million and would attach their coverage at $2.725 billion in losses to USAA, exhausting that at $3.6 billion, sources said.This gives the Class 13 notes an initial attachment probability of 3.63%, an initial base expected loss of 2.11% and this tranche is being offered with price guidance in a range from 10% to 10.75%.A tranche of Class 14 notes have a preliminary size of $125 million and are less risky, attaching at $3.6 billion in losses and covering a share of layer to $4.65 billion in losses, we understand.Which we’re told gives the Class 14 notes an initial attachment probability of 1.18%, an initial base expected loss of 0.75% and these notes are being offered with price guidance in a range from 6.75% to 7.25%.At the mid-points of these spread guidance ranges, the Class 13 notes would pay a multiple-at-market of 4.9 times the initial base expected loss, while the Class 14 notes would pay a multiple of 9.3 times EL, with these multiples appearing roughly 30% and more higher than comparable tranches issued early in 2022.Update 1:We’re now told that the target for this Residential Re 2023-1 cat bond has been lifted to between $300 million and $400 million, so a potential doubling in size of the reinsurance protection it will provide to USAA.A tranche of Class 13 notes had a preliminary size of $75 million, but the target has now been lifted to between $100 million and $125 million of protection for USAA.The Class 13 notes have an initial base expected loss of 2.11% and were first offered with price guidance in a range from 10% to 10.75%, but this has now been narrowed to guidance of 10% to 10.5%, we understand.A tranche of Class 14 notes launched with a preliminary size of $125 million, but this target is now for between $200 million and $275 million of cover for USAA.The Class 14 notes have an initial base expected loss of 0.75% and were first offered with price guidance in a range from 6.75% to 7.25%, but this has now also narrowed to a range of 6.5% to 6.75%, so could price at or below the low-end of initial guidance, we’re told.Update 2:USAA secured the 100% upsizing of its latest catastrophe bond, with this issuance set to provide it $400 million of collateralized multi-peril reinsurance protection.The Class 13 notes upsized to $125 million, with the notes having an initial base expected loss of 2.11%, they were priced to pay investors a spread of 10.5%, so in the upper-half of initial price guidance.The Class 14 notes secured USAA $275 million of reinsurance cover, with their initial base expected loss of 0.75% they priced to pay investors a spread of 6.5%, so below the low-end of initial guidance.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

It’s also notable that the Section 4(A)2 notes are still said to have secondary transferability, which is an important consideration for investors.Both the Series 2023-1 Class A notes and Series 2023-2 Class A notes will provide their reinsurance protection to TWIA, via Hannover Re, on an indemnity trigger and annual aggregate basis, across a three-year term running from June 1st, we’re told.The reinsurance protection is for Texas named storms and severe thunderstorms, so the same as previous Alamo Re cat bonds have provided to TWIA.The notes, both series, can attach after a loss of $2.965 billion to TWIA, we understand and cover a share of losses up to exhaustion at $4.508 billion, with a $50 million per-event minimum loss needed for an event to qualify.As a result, the two series of Class A notes issued will come with initial attachment probabilities of 2.58%, an initial base expected loss of 2.05% and they are being offered to investors with price guidance in a range from 9.5% to 10.5%.Presumably, the two Series can price differently, so allowing TWIA to test investor appetite for one format of cat bond securities over the other.We also assume that this means TWIA could elect to drop one Series, if the other proved the more popular, or indeed issue both, to maximise the opportunity from the cat bond market at this time.Update 1:TWIA opted for issuing only the 144a securities under the Series 2023-1 issuance, with the Section 4(A)2 Series 2023-2 now not being issued.But the Series 2023-1 notes are set to upsize, perhaps significantly, with now between $350 million and $450 million of reinsurance being sought, we understand.At the same time, the price guidance has been lowered to between 8.75% to 9.5%, a further indication of continued softening in the cat bond market.Update 2:TWIA is now looking to secure up to $500 million of reinsurance from its latest Alamo Re cat bond, with pricing approximately 12.5% to 15% below the mid-point of initial guidance.The size target has been elevated again to between $450 million and $500 million of Alamo Re Series 2023-1 notes, while price guidance has been updated again, with latest range being from 8.5% to 8.75%.Update 3:TWIA has now secured its new Alamo Re 2023-1 catastrophe bond at double the originally targeted size, to provide the residual market property insurer a $500 million source of reinsurance protection.At the same time, the notes eventually were priced with a spread of 8.5%, which represents a roughly 7% drop from the mid-point of initial price guidance.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

At the same time the price guidance has been lowered for each of the tranches of notes.The Class AA notes are now targeted at between $100m and $125m in size, while their spread price guidance has been lowered to a range from 5.5% to 6%.The Class C notes are now targeted at between $75m and $100m, while their spread price guidance has been lowered to a range from 8.25% to 8.75%.We’re told there is a chance the deal could reach the maximum $225m across the two layers if pricing is conducive.Update 2:The CEA priced this latest cat bond at $200 million in size, with an average price decline of around 10%.The Class AA tranche of notes will provide $125 million of cover and were priced at 5.5%, so the lowest-end of reduced guidance, a roughly 12% decline in price while marketing.The riskier Class C notes remained at their initial $75 million in size, priced at the lowest-end of reduced guidance again, of 8.25% for a roughly 8% decline while marketing.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Series 2023-1 transaction.Purple Re Ltd. will be registered as a special purpose insurer (SPI) in Bermuda for the purpose of issuing catastrophe bonds for Slide Insurance, we understand from our sources.For this first issuance, Purple Re Ltd. is expected to issue a $100 million Series 2023-1 Class A tranche of notes, that will be sold to investors and the proceeds used to collateralize a reinsurance agreement between Purple Re and Slide Insurance Company.That reinsurance will provide Slide with three-years of named storm reinsurance protection for the states of Florida and South Carolina, we’re told, with the protection provided on an indemnity trigger and per-occurrence basis.We understand the coverage could be expanded to include additional states at future annual resets, making the reinsurance it provides more flexible for Slide as it grows its business.The reinsurance protection is expected to attach at $315 million of losses to Slide, although inuring to underlying cover such as the FHCF for Florida at least and so the ground-up attachment for a first loss event would be closer to $750 million, we’re told.In fact, it seems this first cat bond for Slide will sit at the very top of its reinsurance tower, occupying a $100 million layer, so there is a chance the target size could also be considered the maximum for this debut issuance from the insurtech.We’re also told that the Class A notes issued by Purple Re Ltd. will come with an initial attachment probability of 1.96%, an initial base expected loss of 1.36% and are being offered to investors with spread pricing guidance in a range from 11.5% to 12.5%.Update 1:We’re told that there has been no change to the size guidance for this Purple Re 2023-1 catastrophe bond, with $100 million of reinsurance still sought by Slide.But the price guidance has been narrowed and raised towards the upper-end, with a revised range of 12.25% to 12.5% now offered to investors.Update 2:Slide Insurance has now secured the $100 million of named storm reinsurance protection through its debut Purple Re 2023-1 catastrophe bond deal.The notes were eventually priced at a spread level of 12.25%, so just 2% above the mid-point of initial guidance.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

These are far riskier, having an initial attachment probability of 28.13% and expected loss of 18.63%. There is no price guidance at this stage, we’re told, but if successful this would be one of (if not) the riskiest layers of cat bond notes ever sponsored by Allstate and the price would be expected to be high as a result.With that final tranche, it seems Allstate is testing out the cat bond markets appetite for a much lower-layer of risk, likely given the challenging reinsurance market environment it is likely to face in renewing lower-layer coverage.Update 1:We’re told the riskier, zero-coupon and one-year Class C tranche of notes are now unlikely to be placed with this syndication, suggesting that layer of risk will either be placed privately or in the traditional reinsurance market.For the other two tranches of notes, the Class A occurrence remains at $100 million while its price guidance has been lowered and fixed at 5.75%, so the bottom end of initial guidance.The Class B annual aggregate notes are now targeted as between $125 million and $150 million, while their price guidance has narrowed towards the upper-end at 15.5% to 15.75%.Update 2:The Class A per-occurrence tranche of notes priced to provide $100 million of cover for Allstate, with a spread of 5.75%, so the low-end of initial guidance..The Class B annual aggregate notes upsized to provide Allstate $150 million of protection, with the spread priced at 15.5%, so in the upper-half of initial price guidance.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2023-1) catastrophe bond will be the tenth full 144a cat bond issuance from Florida’s Citizens Property Insurance Corporation that we have listed in our Deal Directory.It is the first not to be named Everglades Re and also the first to feature an industry loss trigger to provide the coverage, as Florida Citizens has preferred indemnity reinsurance coverage in the past.But with Florida Citizens exposure having expanded rapidly in the last year or so, an industry loss index can provide a valuable alternative source of protection, that can closely approximate the residual market insurers’ exposure to any major Florida named storm or hurricane event.Florida Citizens has established a new Bermuda based vehicle named Lightning Re Ltd. that will be licensed as a special purpose insurer (SPI) for the issuance of catastrophe bonds.For its first transaction, Lightning Re Ltd. will issue a single $200 million or larger tranche of Series 2023-1 Class A notes that will be sold to investors and the proceeds used to collateralize a reinsurance agreement between the vehicle and Citizens Property Insurance Corporation.The $200 million or more in capital markets backed reinsurance protection will be afforded on a PCS industry loss index and annual aggregate trigger basis, we’re told.We understand the index will only be based on personal lines losses from named storms in the state of Florida and that the Lightning Re 2023-1 cat bond will provide Citizens with protection across a three-year term to the end of March 2026.Sources said that the index attachment point will be $51.5 billion of aggregate losses, while the cat bond would exhaust its coverage at an index value of $66 billion, with a $2 billion per-event franchise deductible will be in effect.As a result, the $200 million of Series 2023-1 Class A notes that Lightning Re Ltd. will issue come with an initial attachment probability of 2.18% and an initial expected loss of 1.8%We understand the notes are being offered to cat bond funds and investors with price guidance in a range from 11.5% to 12.5%.As this is the first industry loss trigger cat bond from Florida Citizens and there aren’t any other Florida named storm only industry loss cat bonds to compare it to, this being the first such deal in 144a cat bond format, it’s hard to see how the pricing might look against previous deals.However, if we compare it to a Class A tranche of notes from Citizens Everglades Re II 2020-2 deal, that had a 1.93% expected loss, they priced at 6.25%, which makes this look like comparably much harder pricing, as you might expect.Update 1:Florida Citizens more than doubled the target size for this new cat bond, with between $400 million and $500 million of reinsurance now sought from the issuance.At the same time the price guidance has been reduced, to between 11% and 11.5%, indicating strong investor demand and strong execution.Update 2:Florida Citizens secured the upsized $500m target for reinsurance from its first industry loss cat bond, while the risk interest spread settled at the low-end of reduced guidance, to pay investors an 11% coupon.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Should they price lower, it would represent a near -7% shift if they closed at the new lower mid-point of 12.5%.The Class B notes, which have an initial base expected loss of 3.82%, were first offered to investors with spread guidance in a range from 13.5% to 14.25%, but that guidance was first lowered and narrowed to 13.25% to 13.5%, and has now been reduced again, marketed today with a range of 12.75% to 13.25%.For the Class B notes, that represents a possible -5% shift in pricing should they be finalised at the upper-end of the latest guidance, at 13.25%, or a -7% shift if they settle further down at the new mid-point of 13%.Update 3:At final pricing the Class A tranche of notes was fixed at $75 million in size, while the spread dropped to the low-end of reduced guidance, at 12.25%.The Class B tranche of notes was fixed at $50 million in size, while the spread was also finalised at the low-end of reduced guidance, as 12.75%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

They will cover losses up to a medical benefit claims ratio of 120%, or $1.2 billion of losses.The Class A tranche of notes are being offered to ILS investors with coupon price guidance in a range from 2.75% to 3.5%, we’re told.A $60 million tranche of Vitality Re XIV Class B notes will provide Aetna with protection against losses above a medical benefit claims ratio of 100%, equivalent to a $1 billion loss level, which gives them an expected loss of around 0.20%. These notes cover losses to a claims ratio of 106%, or $1.06 billion, so the Class B notes attach first, so are riskier and would detach at the point the Class A notes began paying claims.The Class B notes are being offered to ILS investors with price guidance in a range from 4% to 5%, we understand.The coupons and multiples are far higher than last year’s Vitality Re deal, despite having similar expected loss levels. You can compare the 2022 deal here.Update 1:Pricing guidance has risen for each of the two tranches of notes to be issued by Vitality Re XIV.The Class A notes price guidance has been raised to 3.25% to 3.5%, while the Class B notes pricing has been raised to 4.5% to 5%.Update 2:Aetna secured the full $200 million of reinsurance from its new Vitality Re ILS deal in 2023.We’ve learned that the final pricing for the Class A tranche of notes was at the top-end of guidance, at 3.5%, while for the Class B notes it was at the original guidance mid-point, at 4.5%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The notes were listed on the Bermuda Stock Exchange and are due January 8th 2024.We’ve also learned that the risk model used for this cyber cat bond was one from specialist firm CyberCube.Global law firm Mayer Brown was the transaction counsel for this first cyber cat bond.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Operational Re IV Ltd.","Operational Re IV Ltd.","Zurich Insurance Co. Ltd.","Unknown","Milliman Inc.","Operational risks","$217.25m","Indemnity","NR","Jan 2023","This is the fourth securitization of operational risks in a catastrophe bond arrangement as part of the Operational Re series of deals.Operational Re IV Ltd. is a Bermuda based special purpose insurer (SPI) originally registered in the first-quarter of 2022, but with an issuance only completed at the start of 2023.As with all three Operational Re cat bonds that preceded this deal, we assume that the ultimate beneficiary of the operational risk insurance protection this provides is global investment bank Credit Suisse, while insurer Zurich is assumed to be the intermediating counterparty and actual cedent to the Operational Re IV issuance.Zurich is then the cedent to the Operational Re deal, entering into a reinsurance agreement with each of the Bermuda based special purpose vehicles.In this case, we understand that Operational Re IV Ltd. has issued $217.25 million of notes across two tranches, split into two sections of 144A and RegS note issuances.The operational risk insurance agreement is larger, we’re told, but this Operational Re IV deal allows the sources of capital to be diversified, with Zurich acting as an intermediary to pass through this portion of the operational risk coverage to Credit Suisse, backed by insurance-linked securities (ILS) and other types of institutional investors.Initial discussions with sources suggest the mechanics and motivations for this new deal are the same as with the other Operational Re operational risk securitizations.The coverage is very different to the typical cat bonds we feature, with the Operational Re bonds set to provide Credit Suisse with broad insurance protection against a range of operational risks on an aggregate basis, which we assume to be the same with this new Operational Re IV deal.As with previous deals, this new Operational Re IV has been issued before the previous Operational Re III deal matures, with that one slated for maturity in January 2024.The reason for this is, these Operational Re cat bonds enable Credit Suisse to reduce its risk weighted assets (RWA’s) and the protection these provide may wane as maturity nears, due to regulatory requirements. Hence overlapping them may be attractive from a regulatory capital standpoint.The new $217.25 million of notes issued by Operational Re IV Ltd. are due for maturity as of January 2026, we’ve learned, so we should perhaps expect a future issuance in early 2025.On the coverage these provide to Credit Suisse, presumably the beneficiary as the previous deals all benefited the bank, if the same as the previous three operational risk insurance-linked securities (ILS) deals, then Credit Suisse will benefit from a multi-year source of operational risk protection that includes coverage for a wide-range of exposures.The first three operational risk cat bonds provided Credit Suisse with protection for exposures including: certain cyber risk exposures, such as IT system failure that causes business interruption; fraudulent behaviour both of external parties and employees of the investment bank; fiduciary issues; losses due to improper business practices or unauthorised activity; accounting errors; documentation errors; regulatory compliance issues; HR issues; discrimination in the workplace; or even personal injury.As with the Operational Re III deal, we also understand that this Operational Re IV has terms in place to ensure that no single operational risk loss event, or defined category of loss according to the transaction, can trigger the operational risk ILS notes on its own.We’re also told that there could be some additional exclusions in place for this new operational risk bond issuance, to ensure now exposure to events that have occurred in the past and perhaps also to exclude certain types of risk.Given the transaction is aggregate in nature and has these terms and limits, it would ensure the deal acts as a second and subsequent loss event cat bond protection.The Operational Re IV Ltd. transaction featured the issuance of $217.25 million of notes across two tranches split into 144A and RegS sections, with the tranches corresponding to different layers of risk, as detailed below:$22.75m of Class A, Rule 144A notes.$54.5m of Class A, Regulation S notes.$60m of Class B, Rule 144A notes.$80m of Class B, Regulation S notes.As with all of the Operational Re cat bonds, this Operational Re IV Ltd. deal is likely to only provide some of the reinsurance capital to support the new operational risk insurance arrangement between Zurich and beneficiary Credit Suisse, with the overall operational risk insurance policy perhaps far larger.It’s also possible there could be other, more privately placed tranches of notes issued by Operational Re IV Ltd.The risk modelling has been undertaken by Milliman Inc., which had also modelled the operational risks for the first three Operational Re transactions.We’re told by sources that the underlying insurance policy to the Operational Re IV catastrophe bond excludes any losses linked to operational risk events that were already discovered prior to the January 3rd 2023 issuance date.The policy also excludes losses from any new operational risk event that has the same originating cause as one discovered prior to issuance, as well as any causally inter-related or inter-connected operational risk events.So investors in the new Operational Re IV went into the transaction safe in the knowledge that there was no potential exposure to the high-profile events Credit Suisse had faced (Archegos and Greensill), nor that anything related or connected could affect the notes in future.Also of note, we’re told that one update to the Operational Re IV cat bond, over the previous iterations, was the inclusion of a specific clause to exclude the territories of Russia and Belarus from the underlying insurance policies coverage.Update:We’re told that originally this Operational Re IV cat bond had been planned to have four tranches, but this was reduced to the two, with 144A and Reg S sections in each.We’ve learned the pricing for each of the two tranches, with the Class A’s having a coupon of 6.6% and the Class B’s 7.1%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(BMIR 2022-2) issuance of mortgage insurance-linked notes will be Arch’s second of 2022, but its seventeenth directly sponsored mortgage ILS transaction and the nineteenth in the Bellemeade Re series of issues since 2015.Arch Capital has established Bellemeade Re 2022-2 Ltd. as a new Bermuda based special purpose insurer (SPI) for this issuance and the SPI will issue and sell four tranches of mortgage insurance-linked notes to capital market investors.Each tranche represents a different level of risk and the proceeds from the sale of the notes will collateralize underlying mortgage reinsurance agreements between the issuer, Bellemeade Re 2022-2 Ltd. and Arch’s mortgage insurer entities Arch Mortgage Insurance Company and United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company.Depending on the level of funding secured for each layer of risk corresponding to a tranche of mortgage ILS notes to be issued by Bellemeade Re 2022-2, Arch Capital could secure as much as $358.4 million of mortgage reinsurance protection from this deal.That would be at a 100% funded level for each of the four tranches of notes, but sources suggest the minimum issuance being sought is actually nearer to $251.2 million.So, it appears Arch could settle for anything above the lower amount, with traditional reinsurance expected to pick up any slack in funding the layers of risk within the Bellemeade Re 2022-2 arrangement, we understand.Depending on the notes’ priority, each tranche could incur principal and interest losses should the ceding insurer make claims payments on the mortgage insurance policies covered by this deal.The notes have a ten-year term and will amortise alongside the mortgage loans and covered insurance policies.The covered pool of insured mortgage loans consists of 152,768 fully amortizing first-lien fixed- and variable-rate mortgages, rating agency DBRS Morningstar explained.The notes, once funded and issued, will collateralize excess of loss mortgage reinsurance agreements between Bellemeade Re 2022-2 Ltd. and Arch’s mortgage insurer entities.DBRS Morningstar lists the deal at its fully-funded size of $358.4 million million and will rate all four tranches of notes issued by Bellemeade Re 2022-2:$85.1 million Class M-1A at BBB (high) (sf)$192.7 million Class M-1B at BB (high) (sf)$40.3 million Class M-2 at BB (low) (sf)$40.3 million Class B-1 at B (high) (sf)Moody’s meanwhile will only rate the first three tranches and also shows a funded percentage for each tranche, which would shrink the size of the issuance to the $251.2 million size:$65.97 million Class M-1A, Assigned (P)Baa3 (sf)$134.86 million Class M-1B, Assigned (P)Ba3 (sf)$25.2 million Class M-2, Assigned (P)B3 (sf)$25.2 million Class B-1, UnratedUpdate 1:We understand that Arch Capital opted for a smaller level of funding for the four tranches than either of the rating agency documents had suggested.The final tranche sizes are below, which add up to a $201 million issuance of notes from Bellemeade Re 2022-2 Ltd., along with their pricing:$52.86 million Class M-1A notes, SOFR + 400 bps$105 million Class M-1B notes, SOFR + 750 bps$21.57 million Class M-2 notes, SOFR + 925 bps$21.57 million Class B-1 notes, SOFR + 1200 bpsSo, in the end, Arch Capital secured $201 million of collateralized excess-of-loss mortgage reinsurance from capital market investors with its latest mortgage ILS deal.Arch secured a further roughly $157 million in traditional mortgage reinsurance alongside the issuance of mortgage insurance-linked notes, so still received the full $358 million of coverage it had been looking for.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2022-1) transaction.Now, Allstate is seeking Florida focused reinsurance coverage from a catastrophe bond for the first time in two years, with a $250 million or greater Sanders Re III Ltd. (Series 2022-2) multi-peril issuance now in the market.Previously, Allstate’s Florida focused cat bonds were issued every three years, so renewed, but this year it seems Allstate is coming to market with the deal a year earlier, which will allow it to fill out more of its Florida reinsurance tower with capital market capacity, while staggering their maturities.Using its Sanders Re III Ltd. special purpose insurer, Allstate is seeking at least $250 million of Florida catastrophe reinsurance protection from this new Series 2022-2 issuance, which looks like it will be the largest of its Florida-focused cat bonds to-date, if the target is hit.The beneficiaries of the reinsurance protection that this Sanders Re III 2022-2 cat bond will provide, are Allstate’s Florida-focused underwriting subsidiaries Castle Key Insurance, Castle Key Indemnity, as well as National General and Northlight brand entities, we’re told.For the first two tranches of notes the reinsurance protection will be on an indemnity trigger, per-occurrence basis and is structured to cascade as other reinsurance beneath is eroded, where as a third zero-coupon tranche is indemnity and non-cascading, we understand.The first two tranches will have a three year term to the end of May 2025, while the third would provide just a single year of protection to the end of May 2023.While the covered perils will be named storm, earthquake, severe thunderstorm, volcanic eruption, meteorite impact and wildfires impacting the state of Florida, similar to previous Florida-focused cat bond deals.A $125 million Class A tranche of notes will provide indemnity, cascading per-occurrence reinsurance protection across a three-year term.The Class A notes will have an initial expected loss of 0.67% and we’re told are being offered to investors with price guidance in a range from 5.75% to 6.5%.A $125 million Class B tranche of notes are similar, but riskier, so will also provide indemnity, cascading per-occurrence reinsurance protection across a three-year term.The Class B notes will have an initial expected loss of 1.79% and are being offered to investors with price guidance in a range from 7.75% to 8.75%, we understand.The final Class C tranche of notes is as yet unsized, while set to provide indemnity, per-occurrence (but not cascading) protection across a single year term.The unsized Class C notes have a particularly high initial expected loss of 17.43%, but while structured as zero-coupon discount notes we’re currently unaware of their price guidance.The Class C tranche is a particularly risky layer of notes and they fact they are unsized and lack price guidance suggests Allstate is exploring the idea of bringing capital markets capacity into its Florida reinsurance tower lower-down.Update 1:We’re now told that the size may increase a little, with up to $275 million of protection now sought across the two tranches of bullet bonds being issued, Classes A and B.The Class A tranche of notes is now targeted as between the original $125 million up to $150 million in size we’re told, but we’re now told their price guidance has been fixed at the top-end of 6.5%.The Class B tranche of notes are similar, but riskier. They also began at $125 million in size, but are now pitched at from $100 million up to that amount, so could actually shrink slightly. Their price guidance has now also been fixed at the top-end of 8.75%, we understand.The final Class C tranche of one-year zero-coupon notes, which are also indemnity per-occurrence, but not cascading and have a particularly high initial expected loss of 17.43%, are said to still being issued, but we’re told information on their size and pricing has still not been disclosed to our sources.As a result, it looks like this cat bond will be up to $275 million in size just across the first-two bullet bond tranches, but actually bigger if this higher-risk and lower-down one-layer is also successfully placed, which sources say it is expected to be.Update 2:This cat bond issuance eventually priced at $287.5 million in size for Allstate.The Class A tranche of notes priced at $150 million in size with a coupon of 6.5% to be paid.The Class B tranche of notes priced at $100 million in size, so shrank a little, with their coupon finalised at the top-end of 8.75%.The final Class C tranche of one-year zero-coupon notes, which have a particularly high initial expected loss of 17.43%, were eventually confirmed as $37.5 million in size, but their pricing is not known at this time.Update – Oct 20th 2022:Allstate pre-announced an expected $671 million gross from September 2022’s major hurricane Ian, with an expected $305 million reinsurance recovery set to reduce this to a net loss of $366 million.This Sanders Re III 2022-2 catastrophe bond provides Allstate with occurrence reinsurance for losses in Florida and at this stage we believe the lowest layer, the Class C notes, are likely to face a total loss of principal due to hurricane Ian.The next layer up, the Class B tranche, is harder to derive a loss quantum for at this stage, but there seems a chance this layer could attach as well.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

But being $250 million in size it would make sense for the deal to have been privately placed with a group or club of investors and funds.Artex SAC Limited has issued a $100 million tranche of principal-at-risk Bricolage notes..The notes, which have been admitted to listing on the Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX), all have maturity due at May 19th 2025, suggesting they could cover three US wind seasons perhaps, or a three years for another peril.As ever, we make the assumption that a private cat bond or ILS issuance like this features notes linked to certain property catastrophe risks, most likely representing a securitisation of either an indemnity or industry loss triggered collateralised reinsurance or retrocession transaction.If any more details emerge we will update you.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Baltic PCC Limited (Series 2022-1)","Baltic PCC Limited","Pool Re","GC Securities was sole structuring agent and bookrunner","Synthetik Applied Technologies LLC","Terrorism risk","$131m","Indemnity","NR","Mar 2022","Pool Re, the UK government-backed mutual terrorism reinsurance facility, is back in the catastrophe bond market and seeking a UK £75 million (approx. US $102m) renewal of its landmark terror catastrophe bond.As in Pool Re’s 2019 cat bond, the new Baltic PCC 2022-1 issuance will only provide Pool Re with cover against terror losses that occur in England, Scotland and Wales.UK domiciled special purpose reinsurance vehicle Baltic PCC Limited is issuing a single tranche of Series 2022-1 notes, on behalf of its second protected cell, we’re told, with the target being to sell at least UK £75 million of notes to cat bond investors.The proceeds of the sale of the notes will be used to collateralise a retrocessional reinsurance agreement between Baltic PCC and Pool Reinsurance Company.Once again, Pool Re is seeking three years of retro terrorism reinsurance coverage with its second Baltic PCC cat bond, with the term slated to mature after the end of February 2025, we’re told.The coverage will be on an indemnity trigger and annual aggregate basis, so the Baltic PCC 2022-1 terror cat bond will provide Pool Re with both occurrence protection for major terror attacks and frequency protection for a series of small terrorist attacks.As with the 2019 deal, this is a relatively unusual indemnity retro cat bond, as retro cat bonds are more typically index-based.But with Pool Re mutualising risk from its members and because of the nature of the exposures it writes, an indemnity structure becomes more achievable and so this new cat bond will fit neatly into the terror reinsurers retro tower.We’re told that the new Baltic PCC terror cat bond notes will attach at £500 million of losses to Pool Re and cover a share of a layer up to exhaustion at £700 million, which is precisely the same attachment and exhaustion as the 2019 cat bond deal.The single currently UK £75 million tranche of Series 2022-1 notes that Baltic PCC Limited is looking to issue will have an initial attachment probability of 2.59%, an initial expected loss of 2.38% and are being offered to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 5.25% to 5.75%.Update 1:Pool Re successfully upsized its new Baltic PCC 2022-1 catastrophe bond to UK £100 million (approx. US $131m) in size, while the notes were priced at the mid-point of guidance at 5.5%.For comparison, the Baltic PCC 2019 terror cat bond notes carried an initial expected loss of 2.71% and priced at the top-end of the initial guidance, to offer investors a 5.9% coupon (a 2.18 multiple of EL at market).This new Baltic PCC 2022 terror cat bond will see investors paid a multiple of EL at market of 2.3 times, so despite the diversifying nature of the peril this still reflects the firming of the catastrophe bond market witnessed since the 2019 issuance.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Once again, we assume the coverage is also set to protect some of the fronted risks that the carrier assumes from insurance-linked securities (ILS) funds, such as Nephila Capital.In previous Blue Halo Re cat bond transactions, Allianz Risk Transfer acted as the ceding reinsurer through its Bermuda operation, but we understood from sources that the risk transfer was supportive of the re/insurers work with the largest ILS fund manager Nephila Capital.Blue Halo Re Ltd. will seek to issue two tranches of Series 2022-1 notes, with a $100 million or greater target as of this issuances launch to investors, our sources said.Both tranches of notes will be sold to ILS investors and the resulting capital be used to collateralise two retrocessional reinsurance agreements between the issuer and Allianz Risk Transfer (Bermuda), the ceding reinsurer.Both tranches of notes will be exposed to U.S. named storm and earthquake events, across all hurricane and quake exposed states and territories including Puerto Rico, over a three-year term and on an annual aggregate and industry loss index trigger basis.Previously, the Blue Halo Re cat bonds have mixed aggregate and occurrence cover, in separate tranches. But this year, the aggregate focus is likely due to the higher costs in the traditional retro reinsurance marketplace.A $50 million Series 2022-1 Class A tranche of notes feature a franchise deductible per-event and have an initial expected loss of 4.91% at the base case. This tranche of notes are being offered to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 10% to 11%, we’re told.The $50 million Series 2022-1 Class B tranche of notes are a little riskier and also feature a franchise deductible per-event, with an initial expected loss of 7.02% at the base case. This tranche of notes are being offered to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 15.5% to 16.5%, we understand.For US hurricane risk, Florida is the state that contributes the greatest percentage of expected losses, as you’d imagine, while California holds the most earthquake risk for these cat bond notes.The multiples on offer are aligned with a 2016 catastrophe bond issuance from Blue Halo Re, which also covered both US wind and quake risks.Update 1:The target size for this new Blue Halo Re 2022-1 catastrophe bond has increased by 25%, with $125 million of coverage now being sought by Allianz ART.At the same time, investor appetites have helped the pricing tighten for both tranches of notes being issued.The Class A tranche of notes is now targeted as a $60 million issuance and its price guidance has fallen and narrowed to 9.75% to 10%.The Class B tranche of notes is now targeted as a $65 million issuance, while its price guidance has also tightened to 15.25% to 15.5%.Update 2:The Class A tranche of notes was upsized to the $60 million, while the notes priced below initial guidance at 9.75%.The Class B tranche of notes was also upsized to the $65 million raised target, while pricing for this tranche settled at 15.25%, so again below the initial guidance.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Mortgage insurance policies generally exclude physical damage in excess of $5,000.”We haven’t seen that mentioned with respect to other mortgage ILS, suggesting that it could be that the subject mortgage loans cover an area where a recent major catastrophe event, such as the December tornadoes or Colorado wildfire occurred.Rating agency Moody’s is only rating four tranches of notes from this transaction. Moody’s also sees the issuance as possibly fully-funded, which would be a $317 million issuance:$79.2 million Class M-1A, Assigned (P)Baa2 (sf)$63.4 million Class M-1B, Assigned (P)Baa3 (sf)$126.7 million Class M-1C, Assigned (P)Ba3 (sf)$31.7 million Class M-2, Assigned (P)B3 (sf)$15.8 million Class B-1, Unrated.DBRS Morningstar has opted for the less-funded deal size, of $277 million and will rate all five tranches of notes issued by Bellemeade Re 2022-1:$63.4 million Class M-1A at BBB (high) (sf)$53.8 million Class M-1B at BBB (sf)$117.8 million Class M-1C at BB (sf)$29.5 million Class M-2 at B (high) (sf)$12.7 million Class B-1 at B (high) (sf)Update 1:Arch Capital eventually secured $282 million of reinsurance through the issuance of mortgage insurance-linked notes to investors through Bellemeade Re 2022-1 Ltd., while the company secured another $33 million of traditional mortgage reinsurance alongside it, taking the total protection secured to $315 million.For this latest issuance, Bellemeade Re 2022-1 Ltd. has funded its reinsurance obligations through the issuance of five classes of amortizing notes with 10-year legal final maturities, totalling $282 million issued.The final tranche sizes are detailed below along with their pricing:$63,352,000 class M-1A notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 175 basis points.$58,284,000 class M-1B notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 215 basis points.$118,736,000 class M-1C notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 370 basis points.$29,458,000 class M-2 notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 460 basis points.$12,670,000 class B-1 notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 550 basis points.The additional $33,260,000 of mortgage reinsurance secured was placed with a panel of reinsurers.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Should the claims index rises above a predefined attachment point, for either of the tranches of notes issued by Vitality Re XIII, it can trigger a recovery payment.Both of the tranches of notes to be issued by Vitality Re XIII will provide Aetna four years of protection and each will cover a different layer of its reinsurance needs.Vitality Re XIII Ltd. will look to issue a $140 million tranche of Class A notes and a $60 million tranche of Class B notes, both covering relatively remote layers of risk within Aetna’s health insurance book, typical of how Vitality Re deals have launched in recent years.The $140 million of Vitality Re XIII Class A notes will protect Aetna for losses above a medical benefit claims ratio of 105%, equivalent to a $1.05 billion loss level, which gives them an expected loss of around 0.01%. They will cover losses to a medical benefit claims ratio of 119%, or $1.19 billion of losses.The Class A tranche of notes are being marketed to ILS investors with coupon price guidance in a range from 1.75% to 2.25%, we’re told.The $60 million tranche of Vitality Re XIII Class B notes will provide Aetna with protection against losses above a medical benefit claims ratio of 99%, equivalent to a $990 million loss level, which gives them an expected loss of around 0.18%. These notes cover losses to a claims ratio of 105%, or $1.05 billion, so the Class B notes detach when the Class A notes would attach and begin paying claims.The Class B notes are being offered to ILS investors with price guidance in a range from 2.25% to 2.75%, we understand.Comparing this to last year’s Vitality Re XII issuance, the risk levels are very similar and so are the pricing ranges. Last year’s deal priced at the top-end of guidance in both cases, so it will be interesting to see where the ILS market prices these for 2022.Update 1:The two tranches of notes being issued did not change in size, with this Vitality Re XIII issuance securing Aetna its targeted $200 million of ILS backed health reinsurance protection.The $140 million tranche of Class A notes priced at the mid-point of guidance, at 2%.The riskier $60 million tranche of Class B notes priced at the top-end of guidance, at 2.75%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

US $85m) tranche of Series 2021-1 Class A notes that will be sold to catastrophe bond investors and the proceeds used to collateralise reinsurance agreements between the issuer and NN Re.The notes issued will provide NN Group with a source of multi-year collateralised reinsurance against losses from European windstorms and severe thunderstorms, but the covered area is said to be just the Netherlands and Belgium, so not a full Europe-wide cat bond.The reinsurance protection will be afforded on an indemnity trigger and per-occurrence basis, with coverage running across a three-year period to early January 2025, we understand.The single EUR 75 million tranche of Class A notes will have an initial expected loss of 2.02% and the notes are being offered to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 3.25% to 3.75%.One point of interest, sources told us the notes are offered at above-par, at 101.115, which is interesting as it effectively lowers the coupon slightly. We can’t confirm why this is the case, but it’s presumed to be structural and possibly related to the use of EBRD collateral.Update 1:The first catastrophe bond issuance for the NN Group did not upsize, with the Orange Capital Re DAC transaction remaining at EUR 75 million.The price guidance narrowed towards the lower-end of guidance, at 3.25% to 3.5%.Update 2:NN Group’s first Orange Capital Re DAC catastrophe bond transaction has now been priced, with the EUR 75 million (US $85m) of notes finalised with a 3.25% coupon, so pricing it at the low-end of initial guidance.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

It is also a reflection of the high cost of aggregate reinsurance protection, of course, but it seems likely there is something else structural to this high coupon.Update 1:The Class A tranche of notes remained at $100 million in size and their pricing was fixed at 4.75%, which was the upper-end of guidance.The Class B tranche of notes ended up targeting between $50 million and $60 million of protection for Farmers, while their pricing remained at the 15% it was originally fixed at.Update 2:We understand that the Topanga Re cat bond was successfully upsized to the $160 million target.The Class A notes settled at $100 million in size, with pricing at the top-end of initial guidance at 4.75%.The Class B tranche grew to $60 million, while their pricing remained at the 15% level.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2020-1) transaction.That first Power Protective Re cat bond was a parametric structure, with a novel trigger based on reconstruction cost values within a wildfire perimeter.This second Power Protective Re 2021-1 wildfire catastrophe bond sees the LADWP switching its coverage to be on an indemnity trigger basis.With this second cat bond, the municipal utility is clearly seeking to secure catastrophe insurance coverage against wildfire risks in the region of California where it operates, as its infrastructure is exposed to wildfires. But its infrastructure can also ignite wildfires, so there is an element of wildfire property liability protection embedded in this cat bond deal as well.A covered event can be a wildfire related loss to the LADWP’s infrastructure and equipment and also losses to the LADWP where the utility is deemed liable for a wildfire.Like the first Power Protective Re catastrophe bond, the LADWP will benefit from its insurance through an agreement with a protected cell of Aon’s Vermont-based White Rock cell captive vehicle, we’re toldThe White Rock protected cell will insure the LADWP, while the cell will then be reinsured by global reinsurance company Hannover Re, the same as the first transaction.Hannover Re will reinsure the wildfire risks for White Rock and theen interface with the capital markets vehicle, fronting the wildfire risks for the LA utility via a retrocessional reinsurance agreement with special purpose insurer (SPI) named Power Protective Re Ltd.Power Protective Re Ltd. will issue a single tranche of Series 2021-1 Class A notes that will be sold to investors and the proceeds then used to collateralize the retrocessional reinsurance agreement, enabling the risk to flow from LADWP to the capital market investors.At this time we do not know the size of this transaction, or proposed size, but we’d anticipate it being at least as big as the first LADWP cat bond, which was $50 million in size.The notes will cover wildfire losses across the state of California for the LADWP, on an indemnity and per-occurrence basis, across a three-year term.We understand that the notes would attach at $125 million of losses to the LADWP and cover a share up to an exhaustion point of $275 million. That suggests the maximum size of this cat bond would be $150 million, to cover the entire layer of the insurance tower.The Series 2021-1 cat bond notes issued by Power Protective Re will have a modelled expected loss of 0.64%, on an average fire hazard basis, or 0.76% on a high fire hazard basis, we’re told.The coupon looks high, for such a level of expected loss, with the unsized tranche of notes being marketed with a coupon range of 10.75% to 12%, sources said.Update 1:According to our sources, the marketing of this new wildfire cat bond has been challenging, given the season is ongoing in California.We’re told that the issuance has been delayed, with the deal set to now complete in October.At the same time, we’re told to expect that this Power Protective Re 2021-1 catastrophe bond will be relatively small in size.The price guidance has been lifted considerably, we understand, with the notes now offered with a coupon of 15%, a sizeable uplift from the initial guidance and a reflection of ILS investors appetite to be paid commensurate with the risks they are taking on.Update 2:At final pricing the Power Protective Re 2021-1 catastrophe bond was fixed as a $30 million in size issuance and the notes were priced at the raised guidance level, with a coupon of 15%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Ltd. has been registered in Singapore and will seek to issue and sell two tranches of Series 2021-1 notes to cat bond funds and investors.The two tranche issuance is set to secure Zenkyoren at least $500 million of multi-year Japanese earthquake reinsurance protection.The $700 million Nakama Re Ltd. (Series 2016-1) cat bond is scheduled for maturity in October, so it would not be surprising to see this 2021-1 issuance upsizing to at least replace that coverage, as long as cat bond market pricing is deemed competitive with other sources of reinsurance.Each of the tranches of Series 2021-1 notes will be sold to investors and the proceeds used to collateralise underlying reinsurance agreements between the SPRV issuer, Nakama Re Pte. Ltd., and the National Mutual Insurance Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives, or Zenkyoren as it is better known in the reinsurance market.As with its other recent catastrophe bond deals, Zenkyoren is again seeking protection on a three-year aggregate, indemnity triggered basis, to cover it against Japanese earthquake risks.The coverage set to run across almost five years to October 2026, with three annual aggregate risk periods, each three-years in length, that overlap across the term.The targeted $500 million or more of Series 2021-1 notes to be issued by Nakama Re Pte. Ltd. will be exposed to losses from Japanese earthquakes, including losses from shake and related perils including tsunami’s, fire, flooding and sprinkler leakage, we’re told.It’s said that a Class 1 tranche of notes will sit in a high layer of Zenkyoren’s catastrophe reinsurance tower, alongside some of the coverage from the 2016, 2018 and 2020 Nakama Re catastrophe bond deals.A Class 2 tranche will sit much lower down in the reinsurance tower, alongside 2018 and 2016 vintage Nakama Re cat bond notes, so will be a riskier investment layer.Nakama Re Pte. Ltd. will seek to issue an at least $400 million Series 2021-1 Class 1 tranche of notes, that will have an initial three-year attachment probability of 2.32%, or 0.77% on an annualised basis and a three-year expected loss of 2.2%, or 0.73% annualised.The attachment point for the Class 1 notes is roughly US $19.6 billion and the exhaustion point is roughly US $22.8 billion.The Class 1 layer, which are the less risky tranche, are being marketed to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 1.75% to 2.2%, we are told.Meanwhile, the $100 million Class 2 tranche of Series 2021-1 notes will have an initial three-year attachment probability of 4.26%, or 1.42% on an annualised basis and a three-year expected loss of 3.77%, or 1.26% annualised.The attachment point for the Class 2 notes is roughly US $11 billion and the exhaustion point is roughly US $13.7 billion.The Class 2 notes are offered to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 2.5% to 3%, we understand.Both tranches feature a franchise deductible per-event of around US $2.46 billion.Update 1:Now, we’re told that this Class 1 tranche of notes targets between $500 million and $550 million, in terms of issuance size and that the pricing has been fixed at 2.05%.Sources told us that this tranche of Class 2 notes is also likely to grow, with the target now $175 million to $225 million, in terms of size and pricing has now been fixed with a coupon of 2.75%.It’s encouraging to see that both coupons look set to be finalised in the middle area of guidance, rather than at the bottom, demonstrating once again that cat bond funds and investors do have minimum return requirements they need to hit.Update 2:Zenkyoren secured the upsized $775 million target for the latest Nakama Re catastrophe bond, officially making this its largest ever issuance.The Class 1 tranche of notes was priced as a $550 million offer, in terms of issuance size and with the pricing fixed at a coupon of 2.05%.The Class 2 notes also secured the upsized target of $225 million, with pricing fixed with a coupon of 2.75%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The aggregate exposed principal balance is the aggregate product of (i) loan unpaid balance, (ii) the MI coverage percentage of each loan, and (iii) one minus existing quota share reinsurance percentage. Nearly all of loans (except 54 loans) have 7.5% or 8.75% existing quota share reinsurance covered by unaffiliated third parties, hence 92.5% or 91.25%, respectively, pro rata share of MI losses of such loans will be taken by this transaction. For the rest of loans having zero existing quota share reinsurance, the transaction will bear 100% of their MI losses.”Update 1:Arch Capital Group eventually secured close to $508 million of mortgage reinsurance through its latest Bellemeade Re 2021-3 Ltd. mortgage ILS transaction, but added another $131.5 million of reinsurance from the traditional market at the same time.There were some adjustments to tranche sizes through the marketing of the deal and eventually Arch Capital secured almost $508 million of reinsurance through the transaction.In total, Arch said that it secured more than $639 million of indemnity reinsurance protection, covering a pool representing approximately $28.7 billion of mortgages , using the Bellemeade Re 2021-3 Ltd. vehicle.Bellemeade Re 2021-3 Ltd. funded its reinsurance obligations through the issuance of six classes of amortizing notes with 10-year legal final maturities.The final mortgage ILS transaction arranged breaks down as follows:$122,961,000 class of A2 notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 100 basis points.$104,926,000 class M-1A notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 100 basis points.$64,329,000 class M-1B notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 140 basis points.$81,397,000 class M-1C notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 155 basis points.$115,524,000 class M-2 notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 315 basis points.$19,005,000 class B-1 notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 385 basis points.On top of this, another $131,518,000 was placed with a panel of reinsurance companies, Arch explained.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

If the Triangle Re 2021-3 transaction had been effective in the second quarter of 2021, Enact’s PMIERs sufficiency ratio would have increased on a pro forma basis, without giving effect to any developments post quarter end, to 189% and $2.3 billion above the published PMIERs requirements,” the company explained.US mortgage insurers are now placing mortgage ILS deals at the heart of their capital management arrangements, with the reinsurance they provide a vital lever in managing their PMIERs.For Genworth (Enact), this is its sixteenth mortgage reinsurance transaction and its fifth insurance-linked notes (ILN) issuance.The company said it highlights a “continuation of the company’s credit risk transfer program, which has generated $3.8 billion of excess of loss reinsurance coverage since the program began in 2015.”The transaction breaks down into the tranches detailed below, with ratings from Moody’s:$131.125m of Class M-1A notes, rated Baa3 (sf).$139.867m of Class M-1B notes, rated Ba3 (sf).$78.675m of Class M-2 notes, rated B3 (sf).$21.854m Class B-1 notes, unrated.Rating agency Moody’s explained that, “We expect this insured pool’s aggregate exposed principal balance to incur 2.52% losses in a base case scenario-mean, and 17.95% losses under a Aaa stress scenario.”Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The aggregate exposed principal balance is the aggregate product of (i) loan unpaid balance, (ii) the MI coverage percentage of each loan, and (iii) one minus existing quota share reinsurance percentage. Nearly all of loans (except 31 loans) have 7.5% or 8.75% existing quota share reinsurance covered by unaffiliated third parties, hence 92.5% or 91.25%, respectively, pro rata share of MI losses of such loans will be taken by this transaction. For the rest of loans having zero existing quota share reinsurance, the transaction will bear 100% of their MI losses.”As losses would be applied to the underlying mortgage insurance policies and trigger these notes after eroding all retention, the reinsurance would pay out, causing principal losses, from the B-1 tranche upwards.The Class B-1 tranche will fund 98.6% of a reinsurance layer, while each tranche above will fund progressively slightly less, up to the Class M-1A notes which will only fund 80% of the reference coverage layer.Update 1:Arch secured its latest mortgage ILS at what it said was the best pricing and broadest investor participation of any Bellemeade Re deal, reflecting confidence returning to the market after the pandemic.Arch revealed pricing details for the five classes of mortgage ILS notes offered by Bellemeade Re 2021-2 Ltd.:$194,532,000 class M-1A notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 120 basis points.$93,334,000 class M-1B notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 150 basis points.$97,265,000 class M-1C notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 185 basis points.$105,704,000 class M-2 notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 290 basis points.$31,972,000 class B-1 notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 415 basis points.The company also secured another roughly $93m of traditional reinsurance alongside the $523m Bellemeade Re 2021-2 mortgage ILS issuance, taking the total indemnity reinsurance secured to $616m.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Ltd. will issue have an initial expected loss of 1.36% and we understand are being offered to investors with price guidance in a range from 5.5% to 6.25%.Update 1:St Johns Insurance elected to upsize its first catastrophe bond deal, with the Putnam Re issuance growing 20% to $120 million, meaning it will fill the covered layer of its reinsurance tower.At the same time price guidance for the notes dropped and was narrowed, to 5.5% to 5.75%.Update 2:St Johns Insurance eventually secured its first catastrophe bond issuance at the upsized by 20% $120 million, while pricing was fixed at the bottom-end of initial guidance, at 5.5%.Update – May 2022:The Putnam Re Pte. Ltd. catastrophe bond defaulted and was redeemed early, after sponsor St. Johns Insurance failed and went into liquidation. A premium payment was missed which defaulted the notes and we understand investors received back slightly less than the full principal due to certain costs that fell to them.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

However, the notes will not cover Florida, as Allstate tends to deal with its Florida exposure separately, in a specific reinsurance tower.The layer occupied by this per-occurrence catastrophe bond from Allstate will be $400 million in size, attaching initially at $3.75 billion and exhausting at $4.15 billion of losses, we’re told.Hence, at $200 million in size initially, there is ample room for this cat bond to expand in size, even doubling, should investor demand allow.The $200 million of Class A notes will have an initial expected loss of 1.1475%, our sources said, while they are being offered to cat bond investors with spread guidance in a range from 3.75% to 4.25%.Given the strong execution seen in recent catastrophe bond issues, it will be interesting to see how this deal from Allstate is received, particularly as the insurer has made recoveries from its cat bonds recently.Update 1:We’re told the target has been lifted to $250 million, while at the same time the price guidance for the notes has been lowered to below the initial marketed range.The notes were first offered to cat bond investors with spread guidance in a range from 3.75% to 4.25%, but we’re now told this has dropped to 3.5% to 3.75%, so below the initial range and representing another cat bond that looks destined for efficient execution to provide attractively priced reinsurance protection to a sponsor.Update 2:Allstate eventually secured its new Sanders Re II 2021-1 per-occurrence catastrophe bond at the upsized target of $250 million and with the pricing of the notes fixed at the low-end of reduced guidance, at 3.5%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Now, the price guidance has been fixed at 4.25%, we understand, which is interesting in being actually slightly above the initial mid-point, when every other cat bond of late has priced down, some significantly.The Class B tranche of notes began as a $50 million layer, but we’re now told this has been increased to $70 million in size, so will cover 100% of the layer from their attachment point of $125m, up to an exhaustion point of $200m.The riskier Class B notes, with an initial expected loss of 2.65%, were first offered to cat bond investors with price guidance of 6.5% to 7.5%, but we’re told this has now been fixed at the low-end of 6.5%.Update 2:Great American Insurance Group secured the upsized $305 million of reinsurance protection from this latest Riverfront Re catastrophe bond issuance, with pricing of both tranches settling at the revised 4.25% for the $235 million Class A tranche and 6.5% for the $70 million Class B tranche of notes.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

But being $250 million in size it would make sense for the deal to have been privately placed with a group or club of investors and funds.Artex SAC Limited has issued a $50 million tranche of Series 2021 Class A principal-at-risk Aquarelle notes and a $200 million tranche of Series 2021 Class B principal-at-risk notes, we understand.The notes, which have been admitted to listing on the Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX), all have maturity due at December 20th 2023, suggesting they could cover two US wind seasons perhaps, or a year and a half for another peril.As ever, make the assumption that a private cat bond or ILS issuance like this features notes linked to certain property catastrophe risks, most likely representing a securitisation of either an indemnity or industry loss triggered collateralised reinsurance or retrocession transaction.Update – March 2022:The ceding insurer that sponsored this Aquarelle private catastrophe bond opted to use the variable reset feature of the terms.The $50 million Class A tranche of notes issued by Artex SAC in respect of the Aquarelle segregated account have had their risk metrics updated so as the attachment point is now $1.39 billion, the exhaustion point is $1.835 billion, the modelled annual expected loss is 9.2% and the updated interest spread is 15.75%.The $200 million Class B tranche of Aquarelle notes issued by Artex SAC have had their risk metrics updated so as the attachment point is now $2.98 billion, the exhaustion point is $4.208 billion, the modelled annual expected loss is 4.14% and the updated interest spread is 9.16%.We understand this variable reset was actually effective as of December 13th 2021.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

However, the pricing declined significantly, as the insurer experienced strong execution of this catastrophe bond.For the $75 million tranche of Series 2021-1 Class A notes pricing now been fixed at just 2.25%, which is 25% down on the initial mid-point.For the $50 million tranche of Series 2021-1 Class B notes, pricing has now been fixed at 5.25%, which represents a 12.5% decline in spread from the initial guidance mid-point.Update – November 2021:The $75 million Class A tranche of notes issued by Pelican Re in this Series 2022-1 catastrophe bond is expected to be a total loss following hurricane Ida, as Louisiana Citizens anticipates making a full reinsurance recovery from it.Update – May 2022:The full recovery has yet to be made, but Louisiana Citizens has confirmed it is expected and the market still has the Class A notes marked down for a total loss.Update – August 2022:We’ve learned that the $50 million Class B tranche of notes from this Pelican IV Re 2021 cat bond deal have now been subject to an event notice, with a full recovery expected.The notes have been marked down to zero in broker secondary market cat bond pricing sheets and it seems Louisiana Citizens hurricane Ida losses have crept higher to erode this layer of protection as well.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

They all have been underwritten to a full documentation standard, have original loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) less than or equal to 100%, and have never been reported to the ceding insurer as 60 or more days delinquent. As of the Cut-Off Date, these loans have not been reported to be in payment forbearance plan. The mortgage loans have MI policies effective on or after January 2019. On March 1, 2020, a new master policy was introduced to conform to government-sponsored enterprises’ (GSEs’) revised rescission relief principles under the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements (PMIERs) guidelines (see the Representations and Warranties section in the related Presale Report for more detail). Approximately 99.3% of the mortgage loans were originated under the new master policy.”Bellemeade Re 2021-1 Ltd. will issue the six tranches of mortgage insurance-linked notes and enter into a reinsurance agreement with the ceding insurers, Arch Mortgage Insurance Company and United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company.The two ceding insurers will get reinsurance protection for the funded portion of mortgage insurance losses, in exchange for which they will make premium payments related to the underlying insured mortgage loans to the issuer, which in turn makes coupon payments to the investors.Interestingly, this Bellemeade Re 2021-1 mortgage ILS issuance is the first transaction where the coupon rates are based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), instead of Libor which previous mortgage ILS deals had been pegged to.The deal is structured into tranches as per the below, with their respective ratings alongside:$188.8 million Class M-1A, rated BBB (high) (sf) by DBRS Morningstar, A1 (sf) by Moody’s.$118.2 million Class M-1B, rated BBB (sf) by DBRS Morningstar, A3 (sf)  by Moody’s.$138.6 million Class M-1C, rated Baa3 (sf) by Moody’s.$112 million Class M-2, rated Ba3 (sf) by Moody’s.$21.3 million Class B-1, rated B3 (sf) by Moody’s.$85.8 million Class B-2, unrated.As losses would be applied to the underlying mortgage insurance policies and trigger these notes after eroding all retention, the reinsurance would pay out, causing principal losses, from the B-2 tranche upwards.The B-2 notes cover 100% of losses across a layer of the reinsurance, while each tranche above covers a progressively smaller percentage, up to the M-1A notes which cover 80% of losses across a $235.9 million layer of mortgage reinsurance protection.Update 1:The Class B-2 tranche of notes was not issued in the end, bringing the overall mortgage ILS deal size down to $580m.Arch secured $64 million in direct reinsurance alongside this Bellemeade Re 2021-1 ILS note issuance, taking the total mortgage reinsurance secured to over $643 million.Now completed, the $580 million of notes issued by Bellemeade Re 2021-1 Ltd. break down like this:$188,782,000 class M-1A notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 175 basis points.$118,203,000 class M-1B notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 220 basis points.$138,583,000 class M-1C notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 295 basis points.$112,021,000 class M-2 notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 485 basis points.$21,324,000 class B-1 notes with a coupon equal to one-month SOFR plus 675 basis points.Arch said that 30 investors supported its latest mortgage ILS deal.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2018-1) deal.Fidus Re Ltd. is a Bermuda special purpose insurer (SPI) set up to issue and sell notes to investors, with the proceeds used to collateralize an excess of loss reinsurance agreement between Fidus Re and the sponsor, Build America Mutual Assurance Company.For its second issuance, Fidus Re Ltd. issued a $150 million tranche of Series 2021-1 Class A notes, that were sold to investors.The notes have a roughly twelve-year term, just like the first Fidus Re financial guarantee ILS deal, so provide the sponsor with reinsurance across a long duration.Build America Mutual (BAM) said that the $150 million of fully collateralized reinsurance secured from Fidus Re Ltd. effectively expands its claims-paying resources to more than $1.1 billion.“The substantial growth in claims-paying resources is the result of the continued execution of our long-term capital plan, which allows BAM to build unparalleled financial strength both through organic growth and periodically accessing the capital markets,” explained Seán W. McCarthy, Chief Executive Officer of BAM.The 2018 financial guarantee ILS arrangement remains in force as well, so now BAM has $250 million of financial guarantee reinsurance, on a fully-collateralized and long-term basis from the capital markets and funded through the sale of insurance-linked notes through Fidus Re.The new $150 million of 2021-1 notes issued by Fidus Re Ltd. will provide BAM with reinsurance against losses on a pre-defined portion of Build America Mutual Assurance Company’s financial guarantee insurance portfolio.The Fidus Re 2021-1 ILS arrangement will cover 90% BAM’s claims on that portfolio, excess of $135 million, on an aggregate basis.The subject business covered is made up of scheduled principal and interest payment on select bonds which were insured by BAM prior to October 31st 2020.Interestingly, the subject business excludes any exposure thought to have had an elevated risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

These notes will be sold to investors and the resulting collateral will be used to collateralise reinsurance agreements for the firm’s benefit.As in every Vitality Re ILS transaction, Aetna Life Insurance Company will enter into a quota share health reinsurance agreement with Vermont captive Health Re Inc., and Health Re will in turn enter into an excess of loss reinsurance agreement for each tranche of notes with Vitality Re XII Ltd.The coverage provided to Aetna is really an annual aggregate indemnity reinsurance arrangement, but with the trigger based on an index linked to Aetna’s medical benefit claims ratio. If the index rises above a predefined attachment point level, for either of the tranches of notes issued by Vitality Re XII, it would trigger a payment.Both tranches of notes will provide four years of coverage and each covers a different layer of Aetna’s reinsurance needs.Vitality Re XII Ltd. is targeting issuance of a $140 million tranche of Class A notes and a $60 million tranche of Class B notes, each covering remote layers of risk within Aetna’s health insurance book, which is typical of how Vitality Re deals have launched in recent years.The $140 million of Vitality Re XII Class A notes will cover Aetna for losses above a medical benefit claims ratio of 104%, equivalent to a $1.04 billion loss level, which gives them an expected loss of 0.01%.Given their risk remote nature, the Class A tranche of notes are being offered to ILS investors with price guidance in a range from 1.75% to 2.25%, we’re told.A $60 million tranche of Vitality Re XII Class B notes will provide Aetna with cover against losses above a medical benefit claims ratio of 98%, equivalent to a $980 million loss level, which gives them an expected loss of 0.25%.The Class B notes are being offered to ILS investors with price guidance in a range from 2.25% to 2.75%, we understand.We can compare the transaction to the previous years Vitality Re XI Ltd. (Series 2020) transaction from Aetna.The Class A tranche of the 2020 issuance attached slightly lower down, at an MBR of 102% and eventually settled to pay investors a coupon of 1.5%, after the pricing fell during marketing. The Class B tranche was similar, attaching slightly lower down at an MBR of 96% and pricing at 1.8%.So the pricing on offer from 2021’s Vitality Re ILS deal is certainly higher, which as well as accounting for higher reinsurance and cat bond pricing, will also likely include some compensation given the uncertainty posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.Update 1:Pricing for the still $200 million offering has now shifted to the high-end for each of the two tranches.In fact, we believe this could be the highest risk-adjusted pricing on a Vitality Re cat bond since at least 2013/2014 issuances and it is the first time a Vitality Re issuance has priced upwards during marketing for around the same amount of time.The Class A notes were first offered to ILS investors with price guidance in a range from 1.75% to 2.25%, but we’re now told this has shifted to the upper-end and has been fixed at 2.25%.The Class B notes were first offered to ILS investors with price guidance in a range from 2.25% to 2.75%, but we understand this has now also shifted to the top-end of guidance, at 2.75%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Swiss Re Capital Markets is joint bookrunner","RMS","U.S. earthquake","$200m","Parametric","NR","Jan 2021","This is the second catastrophe bond transaction where the beneficiary of the risk transfer protection is an investment fund under the management of Bayview Asset Management, LLC that allocates its capital into mortgage related securities.Bayview entered the catastrophe bond market in late 2019 with a $225 million Sierra Ltd. (Series 2019-1) transaction, sourcing parametric insurance protection from the capital markets for its Cayman Islands based Bayview MSR Opportunity Master Fund, LP mortgage focused investment strategy.This demonstrated a way for large asset holders and owners to carve out catastrophe risks from their portfolios and transfer them to the capital markets using parametric triggers and insurance-linked securitization technology.Now, Bayview Asset Management is back looking to expand its capital markets backed earthquake insurance protection with a second catastrophe bond, a currently $150 million Sierra Ltd. 2021-1 transaction.Once again, the risk transfer counterparty is the Bayview MSR Opportunity Master Fund, LP mortgage focused investment strategy operated by the asset manager.The Sierra Ltd. Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurer (SPI) will look to issue two classes of notes, that will be sold to investors and the proceeds used to collateralize underlying insurance or reinsurance like risk transfer agreements between the counterparty and Sierra.These Sierra Ltd. cat bonds are particularly interesting as no fronting reinsurance counterparty is used. Instead the risk transfer contract is directly between the Bermuda SPI and the cedent, in this case a Cayman Islands investment fund.That’s interesting because it demonstrates that capital markets sources of risk, insurance and reinsurance capital can be reached through a direct transaction between the issuing SPI vehicle and the sponsor, suggesting corporate sponsors could also achieve this for parametric or index based risk transfer (or perhaps utilise a captive if they want indemnity protection).The Sierra 2021-1 catastrophe bond will provide Bayview’s investment fund with parametric earthquake insurance protection across the U.S. states of California, Oregon, South Carolina and Washington, we understand.These are the same states covered as in the first Sierra cat bond, representing where Bayview’s greatest concentration of earthquake exposure in its mortgage portfolios lies.Coverage is on a parametric trigger and per-occurrence basis across a three year term, sources said.Sierra Ltd. will issue a $100 million Class A tranche of notes that will have an expected loss of 0.79% and are being marketed to investors with a coupon in a range from 3% to 3.25%, and a $50m million Class B tranche of notes that are riskier with an initial expected loss of 2.71% and coupon price guidance of 5.25% to 5.75%.These are the same initial expected loss figures as were seen in the first Sierra Ltd. transaction, suggesting that Bayview understands where its pain points would be and knows where contingent sources of capital are best structured to respond for it, if a major earthquake occurs.The first Sierra cat bond saw its Class A notes price at 3.25% and Class B notes price at 5.75%, so the top-end of the ranges for this second issuance. As a result, it will be interesting to see where it settles.Update 1:For this second issuance, Sierra Ltd. was aiming to issue a $100 million Class A tranche of notes, but we’re now told that this tranche is targeting from that $100 million up to $150 million in terms of size.The Class A notes will have an expected loss of 0.79% and were first offered to investors with a coupon in a range from 3% to 3.25%, but the price guidance has now been lowered, to 2.7% to 3%.The Class B tranche of notes, which are riskier, continue to target a $50m million issuance, with an initial expected loss of 2.71%. This tranche were first offered to investors with coupon price guidance of 5.25% to 5.75%, but this has now also been reduced to 4.75% to 5.25%.Update 2:The Class A notes were first pitched at $100 million in size, but have now been successfully increased to $150 million.We’re now told the $150 million of Class A notes have been priced at the low-end of reduced guidance, at 2.7%, representing a 14% decline in pricing from the initial mid-point during marketing.The riskier Class B tranche of notes are still a $50m million issuance, but have been priced at the low-end of reduced guidance as well, with a coupon of 4.75% and so representing a 14% drop in pricing from the initial mid-point.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

However the overall size of the issuance may be different, depending on the funding of each level of coverage.We also understand Arch is likely seeking traditional reinsurance to tie into the coverage provided by the Bellemeade Re 2020-4 mortgage insurance-linked notes, so could elect to purchase more coverage from the traditional market, or capital market, depending on pricing.This issuance will feature: a roughly $142.1 million tranche of Class M-2A notes that have been rated at BB (sf) by DBRS Morningstar and rated Ba3 (sf) by Moody’s; a roughly $162.4 million tranche of Class M-2B notes rated B (low) (sf) by DBRS Morningstar; and an almost $32.5 million tranche of Class B-1 notes which are unrated.The notes will be sold to investors and the proceeds used to collateralize reinsurance agreements between Bellemeade Re 2020-4 Ltd. and the ceding insurers which are Arch Mortgage Insurance and United Guaranty Residential Insurance, Arch Capital’s two main mortgage insurance subsidiaries.Interestingly, rating agency DBRS Morningstar explained that the Bellemeade Re 2020-4 Notes are backed by the same pool of mortgage insurance policies that were also reinsured in the Bellemeade Re 2020-1 Ltd. transaction earlier this year.Losses from subject policies that are reinsured in this transaction will be allocated first to the 2020-4 coverge levels and these three tranches of notes before they are then allocated to the coverage level B-1 of the Bellemeade Re 2020-1 transaction.As a result, it seems these notes will sit beneath that earlier transaction, which was the first mortgage ILS deal to come to market successfully after the COVID-19 pandemic broke out.Update 1:Arch Capital completed its latest and fourth mortgage ILS issuance of 2020 with an issuance of $321 million of notes through Bellemeade Re 2020-4, adding a further almost $16 million of direct reinsurance at the same time to provide it with over $337 million of coverage.The mortgage insurance-linked notes issuance under Bellemeade Re 2020-4 Ltd. completed as follows:Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

They are offered to investors with pricing in a range of 90% to 88% of par, which equates to a roughly 10% to 12% coupon, we understand.The Class C tranche, the second single year, multi-peril and annual aggregate layer, are a little riskier with an initial expected loss of 1.13%. This tranche is also structured as zero-coupon notes, and are offered with price guidance in a range from 86% to 84% of par, so a rough coupon equivalent of 14% to 16%.It will be interesting to see how these annual aggregate layers are embraced by the ILS fund market and how much coverage they eventually provide to American Strategic and its parent holding company.Update 1:This Bonanza Re 2020-2 catastrophe bond could as much as triple in size, as the target for the issuance has lifted to $300 million.At the same time the riskiest Class C tranche of notes has been dropped from the issuance.The Class A tranche has now doubled in size from $100 million to $200 million, providing per-occurrence and U.S. wind only coverage. The notes were first offered to investors with a coupon guidance range of 4.5% to 5%, but this guidance has now been fixed at the mid-point at 4.75%.The Class B tranche of notes, which will provide annual aggregate reinsurance protection on an indemnity basis, covering losses from U.S. named storms, severe thunderstorms, winter storms, wildfires, earthquakes across just a one year term, running through calendar year 2021, has now been sized at between $75 million and $100 million and the pricing has now been fixed at the high-end of guidance at 88% of par, so a roughly 12% coupon equivalent.Update 2:In the end the Class A tranche doubled in size to $200m, while the pricing settled at the initial mid-point of 4.75%.The Class B tranche upsized to $95 million, while the pricing for this layer settled at 88% of par, so a roughly 12% coupon equivalent.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

USAA typically has these one-year tranches in its cat bonds, normally the riskiest layer of any issuance.It’s the same with this Residential Re 2020-2 cat bond, with the $50 million of Class 1 notes having an initial expected loss of 14.84% at the base case, attaching at $688 million of losses to USAA and being offered to cat bond investors with a coupon equivalent price guidance in a range from 24% to 26%, or 76% to 74% of par.With this layer set to sit alongside a Class 1 tranche from USAA’s ResRe 2019-2 cat bond in the carriers reinsurance tower, we’re told the price guidance does reflect an increase on that year-old transaction which paid a coupon equivalent of 22.75% and at the time was the highest priced ResRe tranche ever.A $100 million Class 3 tranche of notes will have a four-year term and have an initial expected loss of 3.53% at the base case. This tranche of notes are set to attach at $1.875 billion of losses to USAA on a per-occurrence basis and are being offered to investors with coupon guidance of 8.75% to 9.25%, sources said.The final $150 million Class 4 tranche of notes will also have a four-year term. Their initial expected loss will be 2.32% at the base case, making them the least risky, attaching at $2.55 billion of losses to USAA. Price guidance for this last tranche of the issuance is in a range from 6.75% to 7.25%, we understand.All three tranches look set to offer cat bond investors a risk-adjusted price increase on previous USAA cat bonds and the one-year tranche looks like it could be one of the highest coupon 144A cat bond tranches to ever hit the market.Update 1:USAA’s target for its latest cat bond has been lifted and the carrier is now aiming to secure as much as $400 million of multi-year, fully collateralized, multi-peril catastrophe reinsurance protection from the capital markets with its new Residential Reinsurance 2020 Limited (Series 2020-2) transaction.The highest risk and one-year term zero-coupon Class 1 tranche of notes, which have an initial expected loss of 14.84% at the base case, attaching at $688 million of losses to USAA, remain at $50 million in size and their pricing has now been fixed at the upper-end of guidance, with a coupon equivalent price of 26%, or 74% of par on offer to investors.At that level, this will be the highest paid ResRe catastrophe bond tranche ever and represents an increase on previous years pricing that looks to be around the 3% equivalent, in coupon terms.The Class 3 tranche of notes, which will have a four-year term and an initial expected loss of 3.53% at the base case, attaching at $1.875 billion of losses to USAA on a per-occurrence basis, launched seeking $100 million of protection for the carrier. This tranche looks set to increase in size to $150 million, we understand, while the price guidance has dropped from the initial coupon guidance of 8.75% to 9.25%, to now be offered at 8.25% to 8.75%, we understand.The final million Class 4 tranche of notes, which also have a four-year term with an initial expected loss of 2.32% at the base case and attach at $2.55 billion of losses to USAA, were targeting $150 million of reinsurance limit for the carrier, but this has been increased to $200 million. At the same time, price guidance for this last tranche has also dropped from the initial 6.75% to 7.25%, to now be offered with guidance of 6.25% to 6.75%, we’re told.So, the two four-year tranches look set to upsize with pricing at or below their initial guidance, while the riskier one-year layer remains static in terms of size and has seen its pricing rise.Update 2:USAA secured the upsized $400m of collateralized reinsurance limit from its latest catastrophe bond.The Class 1 riskiest tranche priced its zero-coupon notes at 74% of par, a roughly 26% coupon equivalent.The Class 3 tranche priced at the low-end of reduced guidance, at 8.25%.The Class 4 tranche was also priced at the low-end of the reduced guidance, at 6.25%.The Class 3 and 4 tranches saw their coupons decline by roughly 8% and 11% from the mid-point of initial guidance during marketing.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

They have an initial expected loss of 7.59% and are being offered to investors with price guidance of 16.25% to 17.25%.All three tranches will therefore provide ILW-like coverage, stacked one on top of the other, for Fidelis.Update 1:Fidelis is now hoping to secure somewhere between $225 million and $300 million from this cat bond deal.The Class A tranche is now targeting from $100 million to $125 million of limit and the price guidance has now been lowered significantly to a range of 6.25% to 6.75%.The Class B tranche is now also targeting $100 million to $150 million of limit for Fidelis and pricing has been lowered to the bottom-end of guidance at 9%.The Class C notes remain at $25 million in size and their price guidance has been reduced to 16% to 16.25%.Update 2:At final pricing the Herbie Re 2020-2 catastrophe bond issuance was fixed at $275 million in size for sponsor Fidelis.The Class A tranche settled at $100 million in size, with pricing at 6.25%.The Class B tranche settled at $150 million in size, with pricing at 9%.The Class C tranche settled at $25 million in size, with pricing at 16%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Or sometimes syndicated, where a cedent wants to trade with multiple investors or ILS funds in a securitized format.Private cat bond deals can also sometimes involve ILS fund to ILS fund transactions, which usually take the form of an industry loss warranty (ILW).Structures like the Artex SAC vehicle provide an efficient way for cedants and investors to achieve risk transfer and full securitisation of the resulting investment into a form that suits a more liquid or catastrophe bond focused ILS fund mandate.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

In exchange for which, the ceding insurer will make premium payments related to the underlying insured mortgage loans to Bellemeade Re 2020-2, to fund the investor coupons.DBRS Morningstar explained that, “Unlike other residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS) transactions, cash flow from the underlying loans will not be used to make any payments; rather, in MI-linked note (MILN) transactions, a portion of the eligible investments held in the reinsurance trust account will be liquidated to make principal payments to the noteholders and to make loss payments to the ceding insurer when settling claims on the MI policy.”The notes will run across a ten-year term to August 2030, but amortise across that period.Both Arch Mortgage Insurance Company and United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company are acting as ceding insurers for this mortgage ILS deal.Update:Arch Capital’s second mortgage ILS deal of the year was well-received, upsizing to $423 million thanks to investor demand.The transaction ended up with tranches at the following sizes:$91,990,000 class M-1A notes with a coupon equal to one-month LIBOR plus 230 basis points.$95,564,000 class M-1B notes with a coupon equal to one-month LIBOR plus 320 basis points.$128,066,000 class M-1C notes with a coupon equal to one-month LIBOR plus 400 basis points.$89,834,000 class M-2 notes with a coupon equal to one-month LIBOR plus 600 basis points.$17,966,000 class B-1 notes with a coupon equal to one-month LIBOR plus 850 basis points.The company also secured a further $25,747,000 of mortgage reinsurance from a panel of reinsurers in tandem with the issuance of the Bellemeade Re 2020-2 securities.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

– $125.4 million Class M-1B at BB (low)(sf)
– $98.3 million Class M-2 at B (low) (sf)There is a fourth tranche, of roughly $17 million of Class B-1 notes that were not rated.The rating agency further explained on this transaction, “The Notes are exposed to the risk arising from losses that the ceding insurer pays to settle claims on the underlying MI policies. As of the cut-off date, the pool of insured mortgage loans consists of 100,621 fully amortizing first-lien fixed- and variable-rate mortgages. They all have been underwritten to a full documentation standard, have original loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) less than or equal to 97%, and have never been reported to the ceding insurer as 60 or more days delinquent. The mortgage loans were originated on or after April 2019.”National MI said that it “expects to receive initial PMIERs credit for the portion of coverage attaching within the current risk-based required asset charge on subject loans and additional benefit in the future if the PMIERs requirement on subject loans increases, all subject to GSE approval.”That’s important, as the recent Bellemeade issuance from Arch did not provide the PMIERs credit it could have, being higher up in its reinsurance tower.This Oaktown Re IV mortgage ILS transaction is also higher up, hence only a portion of the coverage is expected to qualify for PMIERs credit it seems.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

PCS is set to play the role of industry loss data reporting agent.We’re not completely sure of the covered area for this latest Swiss Re cat bond, but we believe it to be the entire hurricane exposed U.S. coastline (so Gulf, southeast and Florida, and eastern seaboard).Update: We’re told the coverage is for the entire hurricane exposed U.S. coastline, as above.Sources said the coverage will run until the end of November 2021, so providing almost two full hurricane seasons of retrocession for Swiss Re.Matterhorn Re will be issuing $100 million tranches of Class A and Class B notes, with both covering the same layer of risk at an expected loss of 3.24%, we understand.The Class A notes are being offered to investors with a coupon price guidance range of 10% to 10.75%, while the Class B tranche is structured to be issued at a discount to par, so akin to a zero coupon notes arrangement, with pricing guidance offered at 85% to 86% of par value, which offers a similar yield to Class A.It’s important to remember that the Class A notes are floating rate and so will also offer a small return off the permitted investments to investors.Swiss Re opted for this dual approach, of floating rate notes and zero-coupon in the same issuance with its last Matterhorn Re cat bond deal.Update 1:Swiss Re has raised the upper-end target for its latest catastrophe bond, with the Matterhorn Re Ltd.

"Windmill II Re DAC (2020)","Windmill II Re DAC","Achmea Reinsurance Company N.V.","Willis Re Securities is sole structuring agent and bookrunner","RMS","European windstorm","€100m ($113m)","Indemnity","NR","Jun 2020","Dutch insurance group Achmea has returned to the catastrophe bond market to sponsor what will be the companies third transaction and to renew and upsize its previous capital markets coverage from its 2017 cat bond deal.Achmea is a large Dutch insurance group, owning a number of brands across property, casualty, life, health and pensions. The firm also owns Achmea Reinsurance Company NV, a group reinsurer which predominantly retro cedes risk from the Achmea group to the reinsurance market as well as offering some reinsurance to selected third parties.For this new Windmill II Re DAC catastrophe bond, Achmea Reinsurance Company NV will act as the ceding reinsurer to interface with the capital market investors, while we’re told that subsidiaries Achmea Schadeverzekeringen N.V and N.V. Hagelunie will be the ceding insurance beneficiaries of the coverage.For this new Windmill II Re DAC catastrophe bond, Achmea Reinsurance Company NV will act as the ceding reinsurer to interface with the capital market investors, with the coverage cascading down as reinsurance to two of Achmea’s main property insurance underwriting subsidiaries.We’re told that Windmill II Re DAC will look to issue roughly $90 million (EUR 80m) of notes in this issuance, which will be sold to investors and the proceeds used to collateralise retrocessional reinsurance agreements between the issuing vehicle and Achmea Re. Achmea Re will then enter into reinsurance agreements with the two primary insurers.The Windmill II Re DAC 2020 catastrophe bond will provide Achmea with a source of European windstorm reinsurance protection, on an indemnity trigger and per-occurrence basis, we understand.The cat bond will provide Achmea with coverage across a four-year term, so with this deal the insurer is looking to lock-in its capital markets backed reinsurance for a year longer than the maturing deal. That maturing 2017 Windmill Re cat bond was also only roughly $46 million in size, so this new arrangement is almost twice the coverage.We understand that while the covered peril is windstorms across Europe, this could also include convective storms, hail, tornadoes and other windstorm related events, so the coverage is a little broader than just for the main European extratropical storm season.The EUR 80 million of notes being issued by Windmill II Re DAC will have an initial expected loss of 2.56% and are being offered to cat bond investors with coupon price guidance in a range from 4.25% to 4.75%, we’re told.It will be interesting to see how that goes down with ILS funds and investors, given the recent demand for much higher returns on U.S. peril catastrophe bonds.This is the first Euro peril cat bond to hit the market in a while, so could be a good test case for investor appetite for a diversifying region, compared to the glut of U.S. peril deals seen in recent weeks.We understand the Windmill II Re DAC cat bond will occupy a layer of Achmea’s reinsurance tower attaching at EUR 365m and exhausting at EUR 615m, so a EUR 250m layer. It will sit alongside traditional reinsurance, so there could be a chance for the cat bond to upsize and occupy more of the layer if the pricing is deemed attractive by the sponsor.Update 1:The offering target size has been lifted by as much as 25%, with the single tranche of notes now expected to be between EUR 80 million and EUR 100 million in size.We’re also told that the guidance has been fixed at the lower-end of that range, with the notes set to pay investors a coupon of 4.25%.Update 2:European insurer Achmea is aiming to secure slightly lower than anticipated pricing for its new Windmill II Re DAC (2020) catastrophe bond transaction, with the upsized EUR 100 million deal potentially set to come in with a slightly lower coupon now.The latest update from our sources is that Achmea is hoping to get the protection at an even more favourable price, with the now EUR 100 million of notes offered with price guidance of 4% to 4.25%.Update 3:Achmea was successful and secured the pricing at the low-end of the reduced range, at 4%, reflecting a roughly 11% reduction in spread from the initial price guidance mid-point.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Blue Halo Re Ltd. (Series 2020-1)","Blue Halo Re Ltd.","Allianz Risk Transfer","Aon Securities is sole structuring agent and bookrunner","AIR Worldwide","U.S. named storms","$175m","Industry loss index","NR","Jun 2020","This is the first Blue Halo Re Ltd. catastrophe bond to come to market in almost four years.As with previous Blue Halo Re cat bond transactions, Allianz Risk Transfer is the ceding reinsurer through its Bermuda operation, but we understand the risks are supportive of the re/insurers work with the largest ILS fund manager Nephila Capital.It’s believed that the rationale is to cover risks that are assumed and retained through the fronting work Allianz undertakes with ILS fund manager Nephila Capital and any others it is working with. In this way, the protection cascades through to protect some of the Nephila Capital portfolio, with some if not all of the risks notionally covered by the cat bonds related to the fronting arrangements between Allianz Risk Transfer and the ILS fund manager.Blue Halo Re Ltd. will seek to issue two tranches of Series 2020-1 notes totalling $100 million as of launch, our sources said. Both will be sold to ILS investors and the resulting capital be used to collateralise two retrocessional reinsurance agreements between the issuer and Allianz Risk Transfer (Bermuda), which is the ceding reinsurer.Both tranches of notes will be exposed to U.S. named storm events across all hurricane exposed states and territories, with one tranche covering a three-year term and the other one-year, but both on an industry loss trigger basis.One tranche will provide Allianz Risk Transfer with annual aggregate retro reinsurance, while the other will provide second event per-occurrence protection but featuring an aggregate deductible, we’re told.The first tranche of notes to be issued by Blue Halo Re Ltd. is a currently $75 million Series 2020-1 Class A tranche, that will provide annual aggregate protection across three year’s. The notes feature a franchise deductible and have an initial expected loss of 4.41% at the base case. They are being offered to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 12.5% to 13.5%, we understand.The second tranche, is a currently $25 million Series 2020-1 Class B layer, that will provide second event per-occurrence cover with an annual aggregate deductible, but only covering a single year. The one year expected loss for these notes is 5.5% at the base case and they are offered to cat bond investors with coupon price guidance in a range from 14.5% to 16%.The coupons on offer and expected losses show that this is the riskiest catastrophe bond to come to market so far in 2020, so it will be intriguing to watch the response of cat bond funds and ILS investors to the tranches.Interestingly, both feature relatively high multiples of expected loss for cat bond tranches with double-digit returns on offer.Often, double-digit returns mean multiples of 1.8 times EL to 2.2 times EL.But in both of these cases, the mid-point of guidance would offer a multiple at market of around 3 times the expected loss at the base case.So it does seem that the price guidance on offer here is reflective of reinsurance market conditions, which are of course firming considerably at this time. For comparison, the Blue Halo Re 2016-2 cat bond had a multiple at market of just over 2.07 times the base EL, while the 2016-1 deal multiples were well below 2X.Update 1:The target for the new Blue Halo Re 2020-1 catastrophe bond transaction from Allianz Risk Transfer has been lifted by 50% to $150 million, while the pricing has moved towards the upper-end of guidance.The Series 2020-1 Class A tranche began offering $75 million of notes, but we’re told this has now been lifted to between $100 million and $125 million.The Class A tranche will provide annual aggregate protection across a three-year term, with an initial expected loss of 4.41% at the base case. They were offered to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 12.5% to 13.5%, but we’re told this has now been lifted to 13.25% to 13.5%, towards the top-end.The Series 2020-1 Class B layer tranche remains with a target of $25 million and will provide second event per-occurrence cover with an annual aggregate deductible across a single year term. The one year expected loss for these notes is 5.5% at the base case and they were first offered to cat bond investors with coupon price guidance in a range from 14.5% to 16%, but we’re told this has now lifted to the upper-end at 16%.Update 2:The target size for Allianz Risk Transfer’s (ART) new catastrophe bond has been lifted again, with the deal now aiming to secure up to $175 million of retrocession for the firm’s portfolio and some of the tail risks related to the ILS fronting it undertakes.The Series 2020-1 Class A tranche is now seeking to secure $150 million of reinsurance protection for the sponsor.The Class A tranche will provide annual aggregate protection across a three-year term, with an initial expected loss of 4.41% at the base case. These notes were offered to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 12.5% to 13.5%, which then lifted to 13.25% to 13.5%, towards the top-end, but we’re now told has been fixed at 13.25%.The Series 2020-1 Class B layer tranche is still targeting $25 million of second event per-occurrence cover with an annual aggregate deductible across a single year term. The one year expected loss for these notes is 5.5% at the base case and they were first offered to cat bond investors with coupon price guidance in a range from 14.5% to 16%, and we’re now told this has been fixed at the upper-end at 16%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Ltd. (Series 2020-1) transaction that is being issued out of Singapore.Casablanca Re Pte. Ltd., a newly established Singapore special purpose reinsurance vehicle, will seek to issue two tranches of Series 2020-1 notes, currently targeting at least $65 million across the pair, with the notes to be sold to cat bond funds and investors and the proceeds used to collateralise reinsurance agreements between the issuing vehicle and sponsor Avatar.Both tranches of notes will provide Avatar with reinsurance protection against losses from Florida named storms (so tropical storms and hurricanes) across a three-year term.The area of coverage can be expanded at an annual reset, should Avatar have expanded and want to see coverage in a range of other hurricane exposed U.S. states.The reinsurance protection will be on an indemnity trigger, cascading and per-occurrence basis, we understand, with the notes exposed to a single larger event, or dropping down for a second and subsequent event.A Series 2020-1 Class A tranche of notes to be issued by Casablanca Re Pte. are currently sized at $40 million and have an initial expected loss of 1.12%. These notes are being offered to investors with coupon price guidance of 6% to 6.5% we understand.A Class B tranche of notes are currently sized at $25 million and have an initial expected loss of 2.35%. This tranche are being offered to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 8% to 8.5%.Both tranches attach at $17.5 million, which is the size of sub-layers in the reinsurance tower, but being cascading it would take a named storm loss event that reached at least $157.1 million up Avatar’s tower to trigger them on a first-event basis, or a $68.8 million second or subsequent event, we’ve been told.Update 1:We’re told that price guidance has been raised considerably for this catastrophe bond, as ILS investors continue to demand higher returns.The Series 2020-1 Class A tranche of notes to be issued by Casablanca Re Pte. still target $40 million of coverage and have an initial expected loss of 1.12%. These notes were initially marketed to investors with coupon price guidance of 6% to 6.5%. We’re now told that the price guidance for the Class A notes has been lifted to 7% to 7.5%, around a 16% increase in pricing at the mid-point.The Class B tranche of notes are still sized at $25 million and have an initial expected loss of 2.35%. This tranche were first offered to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 8% to 8.5%. We now understand that the guidance for this tranche has been raised by around 18% at the mid-point, with the new range being 9.5% to 10%.Update 2:We’re told that rather than providing investors a coupon payment, the offering has been amended such that the notes will be issued at a discount to par, similar to what you’d see with a zero coupon notes arrangement.At the same time it seems that the now premium based return that catastrophe bond investors will receive from this transaction has risen further, with the returns now all coming from the premium paid by sponsor Avatar and no component from the return from permitted investments.The Series 2020-1 Class A tranche of notes to be issued by Casablanca Re Pte. still target $40 million of coverage and have an initial expected loss of 1.12%.But now the Class A notes are being offered to investors at an offering price of 91.75% of principal, which implies a coupon equivalent premium of 8.25%.The Class B tranche of notes remain $25 million in size and have an initial expected loss of 2.35%.But now, the Class B notes are being offered to investors at an offering price of 87.5% of principal, we’re told, which implies a coupon equivalent premium of 12.5%.At the same time as these changes, this transaction has had its term reduced to just a single year, suggesting the sponsor was not keen to lock-in multi-year coverage at these pricing levels. The transaction is now set to only run until the end of May 2021.Update 3:The term of Avatar Property and Casualty Insurance Company’s latest catastrophe bond was shortened to one year just before its issuance, as the insurer settled for a single year of reinsurance coverage from the $65 million transaction.The reason for the shortening of the term of Avatar’s new catastrophe bond is almost certainly related to the pricing, with the sponsor likely to have opted for a single year of Florida named storm reinsurance protection rather than locking in the cost of coverage over the originally proposed three-year term.Finally, the issuance featured a $40 million Series 2020-1 Class A tranche of notes with an initial expected loss of 1.12% and paying 91.75% of principal, which implies a coupon equivalent premium of 8.25%.As well as a $25 million Class B tranche with an initial expected loss of 2.35%, that are set to pay investors 87.5% of principal, which implies a coupon equivalent premium of 12.5%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2017-2) deal in May 2017 that matures soon. So this new deal can be considered a renewal of that Florida specific multi-peril reinsurance for the company.For this new issuance, the Sanders Re II Ltd. special purpose insurer will seek to issue a single Series 2020-2 Class A tranche of notes, currently sized at $150 million, we understand.These notes will be sold to investors and the proceeds used to collateralise reinsurance agreements between the vehicle and the cedents Castle Key Insurance and Indemnity.The reinsurance protection will be on an indemnity trigger, per-occurrence basis and is structured to cascade as other reinsurance beneath is eroded, we’re told.The reinsurance protection will be for losses from the multiple perils of named storm, earthquake, severe thunderstorm, volcanic eruption, meteorite impact and wildfire impacting the state of Florida.Sources said the subject business covered under the Sanders Re II 2020-2 cat bonds reinsurance agreements consists of homeowners, condo, rental and boat owners personal lines property insurance policies underwritten by the two Castle Key insurers.This cat bond transaction will cover a three year term for the insurers it provides reinsurance to, set for maturity at the end of May 2023.It’s hard to know where the cat bond coverage from this Sanders Re II 2002-2 catastrophe bond will attach in the reinsurance tower for these Castle Key entities of Allstate, but we’re told it will cover a $200 million excess of $20 million of losses after the reinsurance beneath is eroded by losses.The currently $150 million of notes on offer, which could get upsized to $200 million based on the above, will have an initial expected loss of 0.61% we understand and are being offered to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 5% to 5.5%.The cat bond this deal will replace, the $200 million Sanders Re 2017-2 issuance, had an initial expected loss of 0.73% and priced with a coupon of 3.25%.So this new Sanders Re II 2020-2 catastrophe bond will see Allstate paying a much higher rate of return to cat bond investors for the coverage, reflecting the increasing rates for cat bond coverage seen over the last year or so.Update 1:Allstate’s target for this catastrophe bond has been lifted to up to $200 million.At the same time, the price guidance has been fixed at the upper-end of guidance, at 5.5%.Update 2:The upsizing of Allstate’s new catastrophe bond was successful and the deal grew by one-third to $200 million, with the coupon fixed at 5.5%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

This tranche of notes will have an initial expected loss of 3.97% at the base case, attaching at some $2.1 billion of losses to USAA and are being offered to investors with price guidance in a range from 9.25% to 10%, we’re told.A currently $100 million Class 13 tranche of notes is less risky, with an initial base expected loss of 1.08% and price guidance in a range from 5% to 5.5%, attaching at $2.7 billion of losses we understand. The Class 13 notes are set to get a rating from S&P of ‘B-(sf)’.The multiples available from these Residential Re 2020 catastrophe bond notes are an increase from last years deal.The Residential Re 2019-1 cat bond featured a tranche with an initial expected loss of 3.61% that eventually priced with a coupon of 8.25%, so a multiple at market of almost 2.3 times the EL.The ResRe 2020-1 Class 12 notes would have a multiple of at least 2.3 times even at the low-end of pricing, 2.5 times at the top-end.The same goes for the Class 13 layers, as the 2019-1 ResRe had a multiple at market of 4.5 times, where as this new ResRe 2020 Class 13 tranche of notes would be 4.6 times the EL at the low-end of pricing, 5 times at the upper-end.However, the increase is not all that significant, so we suspect pricing may rise above the mid-point for both of the new Residential Re 2020 catastrophe bond tranches of notes.Update 1:Sources told us that the deal documents for this catastrophe bond had to be revised to include a specific exclusion for pandemics and communicable diseases, after catastrophe bond investors requested the change.Update 2:USAA has elected to withdraw the riskier tranche from its newest Residential Reinsurance 2020 Limited (Series 2020-1) catastrophe bond transaction, but will aim to slightly upsize the remaining lower-risk layer of the issuance.The higher risk Class 12 tranche of notes will not be issued at all, we’re told.The lower risk Class 13 tranche that began as a $100 million offering, did then target a potential upsizing to as much as $125 million we understand, but that was not successful and the tranche has remained at $100 million in size, but with coupon pricing now fixed at the upper-end of initial guidance, at 5.5%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Sutter Re Ltd. (Series 2020-1 & 2020-2)","Sutter Re Ltd.","California Earthquake Authority","Aon Securities is sole structuring agent and joint bookrunner. Swiss Re Capital Markets is joint bookrunner.","EQECAT","California earthquake","$700m","Indemnity","NR","May 2020","The CEA has returned with a new special purpose insurer in Bermuda registered Sutter Re Ltd., as it seeks to add more capital markets backed protection to its reinsurance tower.For its first issuance we’re told that Sutter Re Ltd. will seek to issue four tranches of cat bond notes across two series, seeking upwards of $400 million of California earthquake reinsurance protection across the issuance.With the Sutter Re catastrophe bonds, the CEA will benefit from multi-year, fully collateralised reinsurance protection against earthquakes in California on an annual aggregate and indemnity trigger basis, we understand from our sources.Two tranches of notes will provide coverage across a two-year term (the Series 2020-2 notes) and two tranches across three years (the Series 2020-1 notes) it seems, with each featuring annual loss occurrence periods for the purpose of aggregation.Each of the Series of catastrophe bond notes to be issued by Sutter Re Ltd. have Class A and Class F tranches. The Class A notes and Class F notes each have the same risk metrics and pricing, with the only differences being the term of two or three years depending on which Series they came from.The CEA is targeting at least $200 million from each Series of this issuance, but it seems likely that if investor appetite was strong enough for the longer term three-year notes under the 2020-1 tranches, then we could see those upsized the most.The reason for issuing two and three year notes at the same time could be so the CEA can stagger its renewals of catastrophe bonds, but also a way to see how investors respond to the pricing of an annual aggregate deal over the different durations.The Series 2020-1 Class A Notes will provide three years of cover, attaching above a $6.472 billion retention and covering a $500 million layer of the CEA’s reinsurance program, giving them an initial expected loss of 1.21% and price guidance of 4.5% to 5%.The Series 2020-1 Class F Notes will provide three years of cover, attaching above a $2.1 billion retention and covering a $500 million layer of the CEA’s reinsurance program, giving them an initial expected loss of 3.69% and price guidance of 8% to 8.5%.The Series 2020-2 Class A Notes will provide two years of cover, attaching above a $6.472 billion retention and covering a $500 million layer of the CEA’s reinsurance program, giving them an initial expected loss of 1.21% and price guidance of 4.5% to 5%.The Series 2020-1 Class F Notes will provide two years of cover, attaching above a $2.1 billion retention and covering a $500 million layer of the CEA’s reinsurance program, giving them an initial expected loss of 3.69% and price guidance of 8% to 8.5%.So as you can see from the above, the difference is only in duration of coverage between the identical risk bearing tranches of notes, suggesting the desire to stagger renewals may be the stronger motivator.One other key difference between this new catastrophe bond issuance from the CEA and its previous deals, is that while they all provided annual aggregate earthquake reinsurance protection, this new transaction also has an hours clause factor that would allow losses from strong aftershocks to qualify.We’re told the cat bond notes will provide the CEA with reinsurance for the first earthquake loss and then also any subsequent quake losses within a 360 hour period after the initial qualifying event.Not only does that cover the CEA for aftershocks, it also means the CEA would be covered where a foreshock causes a loss and the main quake occurred later, within that 360 hour period.As a result this seems a sensible addition to the insurers reinsurance program.Update 1:The CEA has lifted its overall target for the two series cat bond issuance, with it now said to be from $500 million at minimum, up to a maximum of $700 million of protection across the four tranches being sold to investors.The issuance will now seek a maximum of $400 million of protection for the CEA from each Series of notes issued, but $700 million is said to be the maximum across the two series and four tranches issued.While set to upsize, perhaps significantly, the price guidance for all tranches of notes that Sutter Re will issue have moved up to the top-ends of guidance, we’ve been told.As a result, the Series 2020-1 Class A Notes are now priced at 5%, the Series 2020-1 Class F Notes at 8.5%, the Series 2020-2 Class A Notes at 5% and the Series 2020-2 Class F Notes at 8.5%.Update 2:We understand that the targeted issuance size has lifted again and its range narrowed, as our sources said that the CEA is now aiming for between $625 million and as much as $740 million of reinsurance coverage from this cat bond.As we understand it from our sources, the offering now looks like this.The Series 2020-1 Class A Notes, with a three year term and an initial expected loss of 1.21%, are targeting an issuance size of $175 million to $200 million at pricing of 5%.The Series 2020-1 Class F Notes, also with a three year term and with an initial expected loss of 3.69%, are targeting between $100 million and $140 million of coverage for the CEA, with pricing of 8.5%.The Series 2020-2 Class A Notes which will provide two years of cover and have an initial expected loss of 1.21%, target $200 million to $225 million in terms of issuance size, at pricing of 5%.Finally, the Series 2020-2 Class F Notes which will also provide two years of cover and have an initial expected loss of 3.69%, are aiming for an issuance size of $150 million to $175 million at pricing of 8.5%.So, at a minimum the CEA looks set to secure $625 million of California earthquake reinsurance protection from the capital markets with its new Sutter Re Ltd. catastrophe bonds, at a maximum that could be $740 million.Update 3:The California Earthquake Authority (CEA) settled for a $700 million catastrophe bond issuance with Sutter Re 2020-1 and 2020-2 in the end, representing a 75% upsizing of the deal during its marketing.Now finalised, our sources said the Sutter Re catastrophe bond offering looks like this.The Series 2020-1 Class A Notes, with a three year term and an initial expected loss of 1.21%, reached their maximum target of $200 million of protection, at pricing of 5%.The Series 2020-1 Class F Notes, also with a three year term and with an initial expected loss of 3.69%, reached $135 million in size, close to their maximum target for the CEA, with pricing of 8.5%.The Series 2020-2 Class A Notes which will provide two years of cover and have an initial expected loss of 1.21%, reached $215 million in terms of issuance size, again nearer the upper-end of targeted size, at pricing of 5%.Finally, the Series 2020-2 Class F Notes which will also provide two years of cover and have an initial expected loss of 3.69%, stayed at the lower end of their targeted issuance size at $150 million, with pricing of 8.5%.We understand that the Series 2020-1 issuance with a three-year term that is $335 million in size will complete on May 15th, while the Series 2020-2 issuance with a two-year term that is $365 million in size will complete on May 28th.Register today for

Series 2020-1 and Series 2020-2 transaction, two series of notes will be offered to cat bond investors as Florida Citizens seeks capital markets backed reinsurance to cover some of its coastal account risks and for the first time some of the risks in its personal lines account as well.Of the current $300 million target, Florida Citizens is seeking $200 million of reinsurance for its coastal account tower, with the other $100 million for the personal lines account.Both cat bond series will sit alongside traditional sources of reinsurance spanning some $900 million of its two reinsurance towers, so the chances of this issuance upsizing are set to come down to pricing and how the capital market compares to the traditional market.As we’ve seen before, if catastrophe bond market pricing is deemed conducive, Citizens has significantly upsized on its cat bond issues. So it will be interesting to see how this new arrangement fares, given cat bond market returns have clearly risen but reinsurance renewal rates for Florida are expected to rise too.Everglades Re II Ltd. will seek to two tranches of notes, Series 2020-1 Class A and Series 2020-2 Class A notes, with both set to provide Florida Citizens with annual aggregate reinsurance coverage based on an indemnity trigger, across a three-year term.The reinsurance protection will be against named storm losses affecting the state of Florida where all of Citizens policies are located.The Series 2020-1 Class A tranche of notes currently target $200 million of reinsurance protection covering Citizens coastal account subject business, from an attachment point of $1.446 billion of losses across a to-be-defined share of a $900 million layer of the tower, giving the notes an initial expected loss of 1.93%. These notes are offered with price guidance of 5.75% to 6.5%.While the Series 2020-2 Class A tranche of notes target $100 million of reinsurance protection for Citizens personal lines account tower, attaching at $1.641 billion of losses across a $637 million layer, giving the notes an initial expected loss of 1.22%. These notes are offered with price guidance of 4.75% to 5.5%.Update 1:The sizes of the tranches haven’t changed at this time, but our sources said that pricing has increased considerably.The Series 2020-1 Class A tranche of notes continues to target $200 million of reinsurance protection covering Citizens coastal account subject business. These notes have an initial expected loss of 1.93% and were at first offered with price guidance of 5.75% to 6.5%.We’re told that the coupon price guidance has now been elevated to 7.25% for this tranche, a 12% increase from the top-end of original guidance, or a huge 18% from the initial mid-point.While the Series 2020-2 Class A tranche of notes still targets $100 million of reinsurance protection for Citizens personal lines account tower. This tranche of notes has an initial expected loss of 1.22% and were first offered with price guidance of 4.75% to 5.5%.Now, the coupon price guidance for this tranche has leapt to 6.25%, reflecting a 14% increase from the top-end of initial guidance and a huge 22% from the initial mid-point.These are the biggest price increases seen in the catastrophe bond market so far this year and a clear demonstration of ILS fund and investors demand for higher pricing at the upcoming reinsurance renewals.Update 2:Florida Citizens opted to withdraw the $200 million Series 2020-1 Class A tranche of notes that would have provided reinsurance to its Coastal Account tower.It’s assumed this was a reaction to Florida reinsurance market conditions, where rates have been firming as the renewal approached.The remaining $100 million of Everglades Re II Series 2020-2 Class A notes will provide aggregate reinsurance protection for Florida Citizens personal lines account tower.The pricing for this layer of notes has now been fixed at the top-end of the revised guidance at 6.25%, which represents a roughly 22% increase from the mid-point of the initial marketed guidance range.CFO Jennifer Montero told us that this was a direct reaction to what is seen as irrational pricing in the reinsurance and capital markets, making single-year traditional reinsurance a better option for the Coastal Account at this 2020 renewal.Update 3:Florida Citizens opted to upsize the remaining Personal Lines Account layer of the catastrophe bond issue by 10%, to reach $110 million.The pricing remained fixed at 6.25%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(NYC MTA)","Aon Securities is sole structuring agent and bookrunner","AIR Worldwide","New York storm surge (named storm induced) and earthquake","$100m","Parametric","NR","May 2020","This is the third parametric catastrophe bond to be sponsored by First Mutual Transportation Assurance Co. (FMTAC), the New York State-licensed captive insurer and subsidiary of the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).The transport operator had previously secured $125m of parametric New York storm surge (named storm induced) and earthquake insurance coverage from the capital markets through its MetroCat Re Ltd. (Series 2017-1) cat bond, which matures in May 2020. That followed a $200 million MetroCat Re Ltd. (Series 2013-1) transaction.So it is encouraging to see the New York MTA return for another renewal of this important catastrophe insurance protection from the capital markets.For its third MetroCat Re transaction, the issuing vehicle will seek to issue a currently $100 million single tranche of Series 2020-1 Class A notes, which will be sold to investors and the proceeds used to fully collateralise underlying reinsurance agreements between the issuing vehicle and the New York MTA’s captive insurer First Mutual Transportation Assurance Co., which will in turn provide the insurance protection to the MTA.The Series 2020-1 notes issued by MetroCat Re Ltd. will be exposed to storm surges caused by named storms striking the New York areas and also earthquake risks within the New York metropolitan area, across a three-year term.The reinsurance agreements and ultimately the natural disaster insurance coverage provided to the New York MTA will be on a parametric trigger and per-occurrence basis, with the trigger being binary in terms of the nature of its payout.In other words, for both of the covered perils of storm surge from named storms, or earthquakes, the parametric triggers must be breached for a 100% payout of principle to occur, with no sliding scale in terms of payouts available.That makes for a simpler parametric trigger arrangement, which will help in getting catastrophe bond investors comfortable with the deal.For named storm surges, the parametric trigger would require a storm surge to form from a named storm event (so a tropical storm or hurricane) and for the resulting surge to be recorded as 7.75 feet or above at either the Battery, Sandy Hook or Rockaway Inlet, or 12.75 feet or above at Kings Point and East Creek.These locations are used as they are areas where a major storm surge can definitely swamp the MTA’s transit system, or where a significant storm surge would be pushed more broadly into New York’s metropolitan area.For earthquake risk, there are a number of locations that can record a quake in the NYC metro area and the trigger would require a parametric index level of 1,000 or higher to be reached in order for a payout to come due.The currently $100 million of Series 2020-1 Class A notes that MetroCat Re Ltd. is seeking to issue will have an initial annual modelled attachment probability and expected loss of 0.888%, we understand.The notes are being offered to cat bond funds and investors with coupon price guidance in a range from 4.5% to 5%, we’re told.Named storm risk makes up the majority of the expected loss with this transaction.Update 1:The price guidance for the notes was lifted to a range of 5% to 5.5% after investors fed back on the transaction and noted the change from an RMS model for the 2017 cat bond to an AIR model for this 2020 MetroCat was not felt to warrant the level of coupon being offered.The response was to lift the coupon range by half a percent, which should ensure that the deal gets the traction it requires.Update 2:The MetroCat Re 2020-1 catastrophe bond issuance remained at $100 million in size, so will only partially replace the soon to mature 2017 deal that was $125 million in size.The $100 million of Series 2020-1 catastrophe bond notes being issued by MetroCat Re have now been priced at the top-end of that guidance, to offer investors a coupon of 5.5%.It’s a roughly 16% increase in pricing from the mid-point of the initial guidance range to the new coupon of 5.5%, now offering investors a multiple at market of almost 6.2 times the expected loss.It seems a hefty multiple, but model differences do matter here (especially with parametric trigger structures) and investors we spoke with claimed this is warranted and not purely a reflection of the higher pricing seen in the cat bond market of late, although clearly this is also a factor here and the cat bond market has firmed in 2020.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Series 2020-3 cat bond transaction, we’re told Swiss Re is seeking $200 million or more of retrocessional reinsurance protection against named storms in the United States.We understand the named storm coverage will run all the way around the hurricane exposed coastline of the U.S., from Texas to the northeast.Matterhorn Re Ltd. will issued three tranches of notes to support this arrangement, we’re told, with all exposed to U.S. named storms on an industry loss index and per-occurrence basis. PCS will be the industry loss data reporting agent.Targeting $200 million for the issuance, we don’t understand how that will break down across tranches at the moment, but the three tranches will be sold to investors and the proceeds used to collateralise underlying retrocessional reinsurance agreements between Matterhorn Re and Swiss Re, we understand.We’re told that of the three tranches of notes, Class A and Class B will provide Swiss Re with retro reinsurance protection across two hurricane seasons, with maturity slated for the end of 2021, while the Class C tranche covers just one wind season, to the end of 2020.The Series 2020-3 Class A tranche of notes that Matterhorn Re will issue are the least risky layer, having an initial expected loss of 1.9%, our sources said.The Class A tranche of notes are being offered to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 6.5% to 7.25%, our sources explained.The Class B and C tranches are higher risk but are set to cover the same risk layer, as both will have an expected loss of 4.65%, we understand.However there is a pricing difference, as the Class B tranche of notes that is set to cover Swiss Re for two hurricane seasons is structured with an interest coupon and price guidance of 11.5% to 12.25%.But, we’re told the Class C tranche that provides coverage for just one wind season, is being issued at a discount to par, so akin to a zero coupon notes arrangement. The pricing guidance puts the notes at between 90.25% to 91.% of par value, which would be considered similar to a 9% to 9.75% coupon range for them.If this issuance is successful, Swiss Re will have secured more than a billion dollars of retrocessional reinsurance capacity using Matterhorn Re Ltd. in less than one year.Update 1:The latest catastrophe bond to be sponsored by reinsurance firm Swiss Re has been successfully upsized 7.5% at pricing, we can reveal, with the Matterhorn Re Ltd. (Series 2020-3) transaction now set to secure the company $215 million of U.S. named storm retrocession.At the same time, the pricing for the now two-tranche issuance has moved towards the upper-end of the coupon guidance range.But, by the reinsurance firm electing to issue one tranche of risk as zero-coupon notes with just a one-year tenure, it looks as if Swiss Re has managed to secure relatively attractive pricing for its newest catastrophe bond coverage anyway.It is the Class B notes that were dropped in the end, meaning that Swiss Re went for the single year of coverage, but structured as a zero-coupon issuance in the end, which we imagine was down to more competitive pricing being available for this tranche.So here’s how the new Matterhorn Re 2020-3 catastrophe bond will now be issued.The Series 2020-3 Class A tranche of notes that Matterhorn Re will issue are the least risky layer and provide two years of protection, now sized at $110 million after pricing, with the notes having an initial expected loss of 1.9%. On the pricing, these notes were offered to investors with price guidance in a range from 6.5% to 7.25% and have now been priced at 7%, according to our sources.The Series 2020-3 Class C tranche of notes, which are higher risk and offer just a single year of coverage, with an initial expected loss of 4.65%, have priced at $105 million in size, we’re told.

More details.Update, April 16th 2020:SCOR has relaunched this Atlas Capital 2020 catastrophe bond with a slightly smaller size of $150 million as the initial target and with price guidance lifted to a new, higher range of 7.75% to 8.25%.Update, April 23rd 2020:SCOR successfully secured its original target of $200 million of retro coverage with its Atlas Capital 2020 catastrophe bond deal, but pricing moved up to the top-end of revised guidance at 8.25%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2020-1) transaction.As with other recent catastrophe bond transactions from State Farm, we assume that the covered peril is U.S. earthquake risk, although we cannot be certain if that is country-wide coverage or focused on a peak quake zone like the New Madrid fault, as some of the insurers previous cat bonds have been.We do know that the transaction is slated for maturity in April 2023, suggesting the term of earthquake reinsurance coverage is going to be roughly three years for State Farm, but also perhaps that it was actually issued back around April and has just taken some weeks to come to our attention.As a result, we’ve listed the transaction as an April issuance in our extensive catastrophe bond Deal Directory.The $250 million of Series 2020-1 Class A notes issued by State Farm’s special purpose insurer Merna Re II Ltd. will have been sold to select ILS funds and investors and the proceeds used to fully collateralise an underlying reinsurance agreement between the SPI and the insurance carrier.As said, we expect the reinsurance protection covers certain U.S. earthquake losses for State Farm, with the trigger expected to be an indemnity trigger.We don’t have details of the attachment level or expected loss and pricing of these Merna Re II 2020-1 catastrophe bond notes.

"Operational Re III Ltd.","Operational Re III Ltd.","Zurich Insurance Co. Ltd.","?","Milliman Inc.","Operational risks","$461.22m","Indemnity","NR","Apr 2020","This is the third operational risk catastrophe bond arrangement to benefit investment bank Credit Suisse.Details are scarce with this third Credit Suisse operational risk bond transaction, but our sources said the same parties are involved, with Credit Suisse the beneficiary of the coverage, but provided via an operational risk insurance arrangement with ceding insurer Zurich Insurance Co. Ltd., who in turn enters into a reinsurance agreement with Bermuda based special purpose vehicle Operational Re III Ltd.Operational Re III Ltd. has then issued some eight tranches of notes, which have been sold to investors and the proceeds from the sale used to collateralise the underlying reinsurance agreement between fronting insurer Zurich and Operational Re III.As a result, the structure and mechanics are the same as any catastrophe bond transaction, bringing capital markets backed reinsurance capacity through to support the insurance needs of an investment bank sponsor that requires a significant operational risk insurance policy, in this case.But the coverage is very different, of course, with the Operational Re III bonds providing Credit Suisse with broad insurance protection against a range of operational risks on an aggregate basis, we understand.If the coverage is the same as the previous two operation risk insurance-linked securities (ILS) deals, then Credit Suisse will now be benefiting from a multi-year source of operational risk protection that includes coverage for a wide-range of exposures.Credit Suisse’s first two operational risk bonds provides cover for exposures including: certain cyber risk exposures, such as IT system failure that causes business interruption; fraudulent behaviour both of external parties and employees of the investment bank; fiduciary issues; losses due to improper business practices or unauthorised activity; accounting errors; documentation errors; regulatory compliance issues; HR issues; discrimination in the workplace; or even personal injury.We are told that with this Operational Re III deal, Credit Suisse’s third operational risk bond, there are limits in place to ensure that no single operational risk loss event, or defined category of loss according to the transaction, can trigger the operational risk ILS notes on its own.Which as well as the aggregate nature of the transaction, ensures that these deals are effectively a second and subsequent loss event ILS cover.These Operational Re cat bonds enable Credit Suisse to reduce its risk weighted assets (RWA’s), which may explain the larger renewal a year before the maturity of the in-force deals, as the protection these provide may wane as maturity nears, due to regulatory requirements.These transactions provide investment bank Credit Suisse with a source of broad operational risk insurance coverage, but utilising the mechanism of an ILS or catastrophe bond to secure the necessary reinsurance support from capital markets investors and specialist ILS funds.One other point to note with the new Operational Re III Ltd. transaction is that this is the first to be denominated in U.S. dollars, rather than Swiss Francs. That could imply a shift in the investor base, to more dollar demanding sources, or it may just be for technical reasons, we can’t be sure.The Operational Re III Ltd. transaction features the issuance of some $461.22 million of notes across eight tranches.These included a $25.324 million Class A tranche of Rule 144A notes, a $118.184 million Class A tranche of RegS notes and a $58.137 million Class B tranche of Rule 144A notes and a $22 million Class B tranche of RegS notes, a $104.217 million Class C tranche of Rule 144A notes and a $11.217 million Class C tranche of RegS notes, plus a $122.138 million Class D tranche of Rule 144A notes, a $0 million Class D tranche of RegS notes (it’s not clear why a tranche of zero size was issued).We understand the Class A to D tranches represent different coverage layers, while coupons are fixed at 5.5%, 4%, 3.8% and 4.5%, we’re told.The coverage from this new arrangement runs to maturity in January 2024, with maturity set for the 10th of that month, so more around three years nine months.As with previous Operational Re cat bonds, this Operational Re III Ltd. deal may only be providing some of the reinsurance capital to support the operational risk insurance arrangement between Zurich and beneficiary Credit Suisse.Update – August 2021:It’s been reported that the market is viewing the most junior, riskiest, tranche of notes issued by Operational Re III Ltd. as potentially at-risk, because of the challenges faced by the beneficiary of the coverage, investment bank Credit Suisse, due to the Archegos and Greensill Capital issues.Update – January 2023:We’ve learned that the Operational Re III issuance was matured early and redeemed, with investors being repaid in full.We’re told that realised annual covered losses never actually reached 4% of the attachment point for the riskiest layer of notes, so as a result all investors received their money back on maturity, while insurance and reinsurance interests were released from their liabilities.Credit Suisse sponsored a new Operational Re IV Ltd. deal.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Ltd.So it’s assumed that MS&AD Holdings is benefiting from the Singapore ILS grant for its first issuance to be domiciled there.The Singapore domiciled issuer Akibare Re Pte. Ltd. will seek to issue a single tranche of Series 2020-1 Class A notes that are currently sized at $75 million and will be sold to investors with the proceeds providing collateral to underpin a reinsurance agreement between the issuer and the sponsor Mitsui Sumitomo.The $75 million of Akibare Re 2020-1 Class A notes will provide Mitsui Sumitomo with a capital market investor backed source of indemnity and per-occurrence reinsurance protection against certain losses from Japanese typhoons and Japanese flood events, across a four-year term.The coverage is for Mitsui Sumitomo’s fire insurance policy portfolio, which includes personal and commercial property risks, we understand.The single Series 2020-1 Class A tranche to be issued by Akibare Re Pte. Ltd. is currently offering investors $75 million of notes.But we’re told the notes will cover a layer of Mitsui Sumitomo’s reinsurance tower that is approximately $275 million in size, giving plenty of room for the issuance to grow if cat bond investor demand is sufficient to support it.The notes will have an attachment point that sits around the US $3 billion level, giving them an initial expected loss of 0.81%, we understand.The $75 million of Class A notes are being marketed to investors with price guidance in a range from 2.5% to 2.75%, sources said.The sponsor had previously claimed on one of its catastrophe bonds in the last year, after losses from typhoon Jebi ate through the reinsurance layer of coverage provided by the Akibare Re Ltd. (Series 2016-1) deal.So it’s natural to assume pricing would increase for this new Japanese wind and flood focused cat bond, especially as reinsurance pricing in general for Japan is expected to rise in price significantly at the upcoming April 1 renewals.For comparison, the $100 million Class B tranche of notes from MS&AD’s Akibare Re Ltd. (Series 2018-1) catastrophe also covered Japan typhoon and floods and had an initial expected loss of 0.99% but saw the coupon priced at 1.9%.Which suggests a not insignificant price increase for this 2020 transaction, which will be welcomed by ILS funds and cat bond investors as they continue to absorb losses from Japanese typhoon events.Update 1:The targeted size has lifted, we’re told, with the deal now aiming for between $75 million to as much as $100 million in issuance.But we’re now told that the price guidance has lifted to the top-end of the launch range, with the notes offered to investors with a coupon of 2.75%.With the expected loss of the Akibare Re 2020-1 Class A notes lower than the 2018 tranche we mentioned above at 0.81%, but the pricing some 45% higher, this transactions gives us a decent measure for where reinsurance pricing for loss affected Japanese wind risks are heading for the April renewals (a roughly 45% to 50% risk adjusted increase for this deal).Update 2:Mitsui Sumitomo’s new Akibare Re 2020-1 catastrophe bond eventually settled at a 33% upsized $100 million in size and with pricing of 2.75%, so a roughly 45% to 50% risk adjusted increase in rate from the Japanese insurers previous cat bond issuance.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Series 2020-1 notes is 12% to 13%, making this clearly the riskier layer of this cat bond which is driven by the aggregate exposure.As with other recent cat bonds from Allstate, the design of the structure will provide valuable reinsurance protection to the insurer, slotting alongside its traditional layers of protection in the tower and being available to respond to both large single catastrophe loss events as well as attrition due to multiple smaller or frequency catastrophe losses.Update 1:The Class A notes have seen their pricing for this layer fixed at the mid-point at 4.5%.The Class B tranche of Sanders Re II Ltd.

"IBRD / FONDEN 2020","International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)","FONDEN / AGROASEMEX S.A.","GC Securities, Goldman Sachs & Swiss Re Capital Markets are joint structuring agents and joint bookrunners","AIR Worldwide","Mexico earthquakes, Mexico named storms","$485m","Parametric","NR","Mar 2020","The government of Mexico has returned to the catastrophe bond market with the help of the World Bank and its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), seeking a $425 million or larger slice of parametric earthquake and hurricane disaster insurance from the capital markets with this issuance that is the first to incorporate sustainable development bond features.This latest catastrophe bond from the World Bank and IBRD has a twist to it, in that it is the first ever cat bond where the proceeds from the sale of the notes can be used by the IBRD to finance sustainable development projects in its member countries.It’s a hybrid structure, incorporating elements of a sustainable development bond alongside a catastrophe bond, a concept that has been broadly discussed around the market as one way to tap into investor appetite for ESG assets.It’s assumed that means the IBRD can use this liquidity within its developmental programs and projects, but if the catastrophe bond is triggered it will make up the collateral to the agreed amount.In this way it is a kind of sustainable development bond investment, as well as a catastrophe linked investment, at the same time. Which may help to open up the market to an increased range of institutions and investors, broadening the insurance-linked securities (ILS) investor base.For this new IBRD / FONDEN 2020 catastrophe bond, which we’ve named as such as the issuance has no other defining series details right now, FONDEN, the natural disaster insurance fund of Mexico, is the ultimate insured along with its trustees.The trustee of FONDEN acts as the insured for the coverage, entering into an insurance agreement with the Mexican government-owned insurer Agroasemex S.A.Agroasemex S.A. then enters into a reinsurance arrangement with Swiss Re, who act as the ceding reinsurance firm, and Swiss Re in turn enters into retrocessional agreements with the IBRD, the issuer of the notes.In this case, the retrocessional reinsurance agreements will be capitalised by the sale of four tranches of catastrophe bond notes, that will be sold to capital market investors to fully collateralise the transaction.There will be two tranches of earthquake-linked notes issued, as well as one tranche of notes covering Atlantic named storms and one covering Pacific named storms, so providing protection for the two main natural disaster perils Mexico faces, hurricane and earthquake risks.All four tranches of notes will provide their disaster insurance coverage to the Mexican government on a parametric trigger and per-occurrence basis across a four-year term, we understand.The covered area for both perils are the exposed areas of Mexico, as well as some small overlapping areas of the United States where earthquakes could occur and still cause significant damage in Mexico, or a hurricane could come ashore and breach the parametric trigger in the U.S. but then impact Mexico significantly as well.At this time the transaction is offering cat bond investors $425 million of notes across the two perils of wind and quake in four tranches of catastrophe-linked Capital At Risk notes to be issued by the IBRD, we’re told.A $125 million tranche of Class A notes is a lower-risk earthquake exposed tranche of notes, having a modelled expected loss of 0.9% and price guidance of 3% to 3.5%.A $100 million tranche of Class B notes is a higher-risk earthquake exposed tranche, with a modelled expected loss of 5.78% and price guidance of 8.25% to 8.75%.A $100 million tranche of Class C notes will cover named storms and hurricanes on the Atlantic coast, with a modelled expected loss of 5.61% at the base case and price guidance for investors of 10% to 10.5%.The final tranche is a $100 million Class D layer, to cover named storms and hurricanes on the Pacific coast of Mexico, which have a modelled expected loss of 4.06% and are offered to investors with price guidance of 6.75% to 7.25%.We understand the parametric trigger for earthquake risks is based on magnitude and location of occurrence, with Mexico broken up into boxes for each tranche of notes and payout rates of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of principal determined by where a quake strikes and how powerful it is.That’s the same kind of trigger as previous World Bank earthquake cat bonds for Mexico, but we’re also told that the boxes are now much smaller around significant population centres, to allow for a more highly calibrated parametric trigger to enhance the protection.On the named storm and hurricane side, the parametric trigger design is similar again to previous World Bank catastrophe bonds for Mexico’s FONDEN.That means there is a line along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, for the respective tranches of notes, over which a hurricanes eye needs to pass with a certain minimum central pressure or lower for a payout of 25%, 50% or 100% to become due.Hence, it is location and severity that are the core components of both earthquake and hurricane parametric triggers and will define whether any tranches of this new Mexico catastrophe bond pay out over the four years it is in-force and providing the country with disaster insurance protection.Update 1:This issuance is now targeting from $410 million to as much as $525 million of disaster insurance protection from the capital markets, making it the largest so far from Mexico and more than a replacement for the soon to mature $260 million 2018 issuance IBRD CAR 118-119.The first tranche of Class A notes, a lower-risk earthquake exposed layer, launched targeting $125 million of protection for Mexico from notes having a modelled expected loss of 0.9% and price guidance of 3% to 3.5%. Now, we’re told, this tranche is targeting an upsized $150 million to $175 million of coverage, with price guidance now fixed at the top-end of guidance at 3.5%.What was a $100 million tranche of Class B notes, a higher-risk earthquake exposed layer with a modelled expected loss of 5.78% and initial price guidance of 8.25% to 8.75%, is now targeting $60 million to $100 million and with tightened price guidance of 8.75% to 9%, so at the top-end or above of initial spread guidance, we understand.What was a $100 million tranche of Class C notes, covering named storms and hurricanes on the Atlantic coast and with a modelled expected loss of 5.61% at the base case, had initial price guidance for investors of 10% to 10.5%. This tranche is now marketed as targeting $100 million to $125 million with price guidance tightened to 10% to 10.25%.The final $100 million Class D tranche, covering named storms and hurricanes on the Pacific coast of Mexico with a modelled expected loss of 4.06% , were initially offered to investors with price guidance of 6.75% to 7.25%. This tranche is now also targeting $100 million to $125 million with price guidance tightened to 6.5% to 6.75%.From the way the pricing has moved it looks like investors demanded more spread on the earthquake exposed layers of notes, perhaps a reflection of recent quake activity in the country, but also of losses paid historically for Mexico from its catastrophe bonds.Update 2:At pricing, the IBRD / FONDEN 2020 catastrophe bond sponsored by the Mexican government upsized by 14% to settle offering $485 million of capital markets backed natural disaster insurance protection.The Class A notes, a lower-risk earthquake exposed layer, secured the upper-end of the targeted range at $175 million in size, but at top-end of pricing at 3.5%.The Class B notes, a higher-risk earthquake exposed layer, were priced at $60 million in size, we’re told, the lower-end of the target, with pricing of 9%, so the upper end of revised guidance and above the initial guidance range.The Class C tranche of notes, covering named storms and hurricanes on the Atlantic coast priced at $125 million in size, with pricing of 10%, so at the lower-end of initial guidance.The final $100 million Class D tranche, covering named storms and hurricanes on the Pacific coast of Mexico, also achieved the upper-end of the targeted size at $125 million, with pricing of 6.5% actually below the initial guidance range.So a mixed result in terms of demand and pricing, with the riskier earthquake layer of notes seemingly less popular with the cat bond investor base.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

We were told that the transaction did not receive the necessary support in the market and as a result the book failed to build sufficiently in the early stages. There had been an appetite to get the deal done at a smaller size but even that failed, we’re told, suggesting a lack of investor appetite for the risk at the offered pricing level. It’s likely United (UPC) will secure the coverage from a traditional reinsurance arrangement instead, although possibly from a collateralised source.This is United Insurance Holdings third catastrophe bond issuance under its Armor Re II Ltd. Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurance vehicle.Florida headquartered, expansive primary insurer United Insurance Holdings (UPC Insurance) has returned to the catastrophe bond market in search of a fresh source of capital markets backed catastrophe reinsurance protection, to expand on the $100 million of in-force cat bond coverage it has from its 2019 issuances.This new transaction seeks to replace and upsize the $100 million Armor Re II 2018 cat bond that matures in May 2020.The company’s Armor Re II Ltd. special purpose insurer will seek to issue a single tranche of Series 2020-1 Class A notes that will be offered and sold to ILS investors and the proceeds used to collateralise underlying reinsurance agreements to the benefit of United’s insurers.The beneficiaries of the firm’s latest catastrophe bond deal will be subsidiaries United Property & Casualty Insurance Co., Family Security Insurance Co. and American Coastal Insurance to begin with, we understand.United (UPC) is seeking a fully collateralised source of catastrophe reinsurance protection against losses from U.S. named storms and U.S. earthquakes across a three-year term with this arrangement, with the cat bond coming on-risk at June 1st this year.The reinsurance protection will be afforded on an indemnity and per-occurrence basis, structured as cascading coverage as the insurers other recent catastrophe bonds have been, meaning the attachment level can adjust during an annual risk period, as qualifying loss events erode away any other layers of reinsurance protection that inure to the benefit of this cat bond.As a result the coverage is seen to work more closely with other traditional reinsurance layers within the United (UPC) reinsurance program.The issuance is targeting $130 million of coverage for the sponsor, through the sale of a single Class A tranche of Series 2020-1 notes.The $130 million of Armor Re II 2020-1 Class A notes are set to attach at $25 million of losses (the tower retention) and sit above the inuring catastrophe reinsurance layers, with an initial attachment probability of 1.77% and expected loss of 1.64%, both at the base case.We understand that this 2020 Armor Re II cat bond will effectively sit at the top of the reinsurance tower for United (UPC), even above the insurers 2019 cat bond deal, with the attachment point being around the $1.33 billion mark. We understand the layer it will cover is also sized at $130 million, which suggests the cat bond won’t upsize beyond its launch indication.We’re told that the $130 million of notes are being offered to catastrophe bond investors with price guidance in a range from 6.25% to 6.75%.Compared to the insurers 2019 cat bond that represents an uptick in pricing, especially considering this transaction will sit a little higher in the tower as well as being priced at a higher level.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

This tranche of notes will have an initial expected loss of 1.3% at the base case and are offered to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 5.25% to 6%, we’re told.A $100 million Series 2020-1 Class B-1 tranche of per-occurrence notes will provide four years of protection, covering the same layer as the A-1’s. This tranche of notes will have an initial expected loss of 1.3% at the base case and are also offered to cat bond investors with the same price guidance, so 5.25% to 6%.A $50 million tranche of Series 2020-2 Class A-2 notes, the first aggregate tranche, will provide three years of protection attaching at $1.775 billion and covering losses to $1.88 billion, with events needing to surpass a $50 million franchise deductible. These notes will have an initial expected loss of 0.97% at the base case and have price guidance of 5% to 5.75%.A $50 million tranche of Series 2020-2 Class B-2 notes, also annual aggregate and providing three years of protection, would attach at $1.575 billion and covering losses to $1.775 billion, again after a $50 million franchise deductible per event. These notes will have an initial expected loss of 1.7% at the base case and have price guidance of 7% to 8%.The final $40 million tranche of Series 2020-2 Class C-2 notes, also annual aggregate and providing three years of protection, would attach at $1.28 billion and covering losses to $1.575 billion, again after a $50 million franchise deductible per event. These notes will have an initial expected loss of 4.1% at the base case and have price guidance of 12% to 13%.So the two Series 2020-1 per-occurrence tranches of notes will together cover a $400 million layer of Nationwide Mutual’s reinsurance tower, while the three Series 2020-2 tranches will stack one on top of the other, covering a percentage of a $600 million layer of the sponsors aggregate reinsurance program.The size of the layers mean there is room for each tranche of notes to upsize, should pricing and ILS investor appetites prove accommodating.Update 1:We’re now told that the issuance looks set to upsize from the initial $340 million goal, with the target for the Caelus Re VI 2020 catastrophe bond issuance now lifted to up to $500 million in size.That would make this new cat bond the largest Nationwide Mutual Insurance has ever sponsored, a record currently held by the insurers 2018 deal that settled at $450 million.At the same time, all of the tranches have seen their pricing guidance shifted towards the mid to upper-ends of the initial ranges.The first Series 2020-1 Class A-1 tranche of per-occurrence notes that will provide three years of coverage are now targeting between $100 million and $150 million in terms of issuance size. With an initial expected loss of 1.3% at the base case, these notes were offered to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 5.25% to 6% to begin, but we’re now told this has tightened to 5.5% to 5.75%The Series 2020-1 Class B-1 tranche of per-occurrence notes, providing four years of protection,  are also now targeting between $100 million and $150 million of cover for Nationwide. This tranche of notes have an initial expected loss of 1.3% at the base case and were offered to cat bond investors with the same price guidance, so 5.25% to 6%, which again has now tightened to 5.5% to 5.75%.The Series 2020-2 Class A-2 notes, set to provide three years of aggregate reinsurance protection, are now targeting between $50 million and $75 million in terms of size. These notes have an initial expected loss of 0.97% at the base case and were at first offered with price guidance of 5% to 5.75%, but this has now shifted to 5.5% to 5.75%, we’re told.The Series 2020-2 Class B-2 notes, also annual aggregate and providing three years of protection, are also now aiming for an issuance size of between $50 million and $75 million. These notes have an initial expected loss of 1.7% at the base case and were marketed with price guidance of 7% to 8%, which we now understand towards the upper-end at guidance of 7.5% to 8%.The final Series 2020-2 Class C-2 tranche of notes, also annual aggregate and covering three years, are now looking to secure. between $40 million and $50 million of cover for the sponsor. These notes have an initial expected loss of 4.1% at the base case and were at first marketed with price guidance of 12% to 13%, but this has now shifted upwards again to 12.75% to 13%, sources said.Update 2:This Caelus Re VI 2020 catastrophe bond has now settled at $490 million in size, so representing a 44% increase from the initially marketed tranche sizes.The first Series 2020-1 Class A-1 tranche of per-occurrence notes, providing three years of coverage, settled at the upper-end of $150 million and with pricing fixed at 5.5%, so a little below the mid-point of guidance.The Series 2020-1 Class B-1 tranche of per-occurrence notes, providing four years of protection, also settled at the top-end of $150 million and also priced at 5.5%.The Series 2020-2 Class A-2 notes, set to provide three years of aggregate reinsurance protection, settled at the upper-end at $75 million with pricing fixed at 5.5%, so towards the upper-end of guidance.The Series 2020-2 Class B-2 notes, also annual aggregate and providing three years of protection, also settled at $75 million and priced at 7.75%, so almost at the top-end of guidance.The final Series 2020-2 Class C-2 tranche of notes, also annual aggregate and covering three years, settled at the lower-end of their target size of $40 million, with pricing fixed at 12.75%, again in the upper-half of guidance.Update April 2021:Nationwide’s aggregate losses for the current risk period have now risen to a level where tranches of this cat bond are threatened.As of April 14th, the insurer had reported an ultimate of almost $1.5 billion for the risk period, with roughly $335 million of losses appears to have been added by the February winter storms and deep freeze that impacted a wide area of the United States and in particular the state of Texas.The Caelus Re VI 2020-2 Class C-2 notes, a $40 million layer providing the insurer annual aggregate reinsurance, have their attachment point set at $1.28 billion and cover a percentage of losses up to $1.575 billion, so the information we have sourced seems to suggest there is a strong chance of this tranche being a total loss.Secondary cat bond market pricing sheets reflect that, with the Caelus Re VI 2020-2 Class C-2 notes priced down for bids in the single digits, implying the market believes at least a 90% loss of principal will occur.The $75 million Series 2020-2 Class B-2 notes from this Caelus Re VI issuance, also annual aggregate and providing three years of reinsurance protection, could attach at $1.575 billion and cover losses to $1.775 billion, so also appear threatened. This tranche is also heavily marked down on broker pricing sheets, at levels implying a 75% loss of principal.The also $75 million Series 2020-2 Class A-2 notes from this Caelus Re VI issuance are also marked down, by around 30%, but attach much higher at $1.775 billion, covering losses to $1.88 billion, so while exposed to Nationwide’s rising annual losses would need to see the aggregate ultimate loss rise much further.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2020-1) cat bond will sit alongside traditional sources of reinsurance and FEMA’s two other FloodSmart Re catastrophe bonds from 2018 and 2019.If successful with its latest issuance, FEMA will benefit from at least $1.1 billion of catastrophe bond backed flood reinsurance coverage after this deal is issued.This new transaction will see special purpose insurer FloodSmart Re Ltd. issuing two tranches of notes that will be sold to catastrophe bond funds and investors and the proceeds used to collateralise retrocessional reinsurance agreements with the ceding reinsurer that is global player Hannover Re, using its Irish company Hannover Re (Ireland) DAC.Hannover Re has played this intermediary ceding reinsurance role in all of FEMA’s NFIP flood cat bonds, helping the government agency to efficiently access the capital markets as a source of reinsurance protection.Hannover Re will pass on the protection from FloodSmart Re through reinsurance agreements entered into with FEMA and the NFIP, the ultimate reinsured party and beneficiary of the flood reinsurance protection.The deal is targeting $300 million of flood reinsurance protection for FEMA’s NFIP program, which will be provided on an indemnity trigger and per-occurrence basis, we’re told.A lower risk Class A tranche targets a $200 million issuance, while a riskier $100 million Class B tranche of notes will sit beneath them.Like the previous two FloodSmart Re cat bonds, the coverage FEMA is seeking will provide reinsurance protection for major flood loss events emanating from named storms, so tropical depressions, storms and hurricanes.The coverage will be across the entire United States, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and D.C. and the deal will provide flood reinsurance to the NFIP across a three-year term.We understand the $200 million of FloodSmart Re Series 2020-1 Class A notes will sit up alongside the higher layers of FEMA’s NFIP flood reinsurance, attaching at $9 billion of losses and exhausting at $10 billion, giving them an initial expected loss of 3.91%.The Class A notes are being marketed to investors with coupon guidance in a range from 10.75% to 11.5%.The smaller $100 million tranche of Series 2020-1 Class B notes that FloodSmart Re will issue will sit below the A’s, lower down in the NFIP reinsurance program, with an attachment point at $6 billion of losses and covering a percentage of losses up to $9 billion, which gives them an initial expected loss of 5.68%.This tranche is offered to cat bond investors with coupon guidance in a range from 13.75% to 14.5%.The pricing is close to the 2019 FloodSmart Re cat bond, although the Class A tranche attachment point is slightly higher and the Class B notes covers a smaller percentage of losses, over a more extended slice of the NFIP reinsurance program.Update 1:We now understand that the lower risk Class A tranche has a new target for between $200 million to as much as $300 million of notes issued, while the riskier Class B layer is still targeting the same $100 million.The now $200 million to $300 million of FloodSmart Re Series 2020-1 Class A notes, which have an initial expected loss of 3.91%, were initially marketed to investors with coupon guidance in a range from 10.75% to 11.5%.We’re now told the guidance for the potentially upsizing Class A tranche has been narrowed towards the upper end at 11% to 11.5%, as final allocations are sought.The smaller, riskier and still $100 million tranche of Series 2020-1 Class B notes that FloodSmart Re, which have an initial expected loss of 5.68%, were at first offered to cat bond investors with coupon guidance in a range from 13.75% to 14.5%.We’re now told the Class B layer pricing has been fixed at the upper-end of that range, at 14.5%.Update 2:FEMA’s third flood catastrophe bond has settled at the upsized $400 million.The Class A tranche successfully secured the $300 million revised target and pricing for these notes was fixed at 11%, so the bottom of the revised coupon guidance range.The Class B tranche remained $100 million in size, with coupon pricing of 14.5%.Update – March 10th, 2023:One tranche of the FloodSmart Re catastrophe bond program has had its maturity extended to allow for further development of the NFIP’s flood insurance losses from hurricane Ian.The $100 million Class B tranche of Series 2020-1 cat bond notes issued by FloodSmart Re in February 2020 saw a partial redemption first, with the outstanding principal reduced by $80 million, so leaving just $20 million of the notes outstanding and then the maturity date extended to the end of February 2027.Update – March 29th, 2023:A further partial redemption was made of $10 million, leaving just $10 million still outstanding and extended till the end of February 2023.Presumably this additional redemption will have been to return more capital to investors, as FEMA’s clarity over its eventual hurricane Ian loss exposure increases.Register today

There is a franchise deductible per-event of JPY 270 billion (around US $2.45bn).We understand that the $150 million or greater of Nakama Re 2020-1 Class 1 notes will be offered to cat bond investors with a narrow range of 2% to 2.2%, sources said.These notes will sit exactly alongside the $500 million of Class 1 notes from the most recent Nakama Re Ltd. (Series 2018-1) catastrophe bond, which were eventually priced at 2%, so it will be interesting to see where this fresh issuance settles.Update 1:Zenkyoren’s latest catastrophe bond has increased in size by one-third, to reach $200 million.At the same time the pricing has been fixed at the upper-end of initial guidance, at 2.2%. So this is slightly higher than the 2018 pricing for a cat bond that sits alongside this new issuance.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

But this has now been narrowed and has fallen to below the lower-end of initial guidance at 6.25% to 6.5%.This transaction is particularly noteworthy, as it is the first catastrophe bond to cover extreme mortality risks that we’ve listed in our comprehensive Deal Directory since 2015.Update 1:At close, the Class A tranche (named storm and mortality risks) settled at $80 million in size, while the Class B named storm only tranche settled at the upper end of targets at $175 million, so combined offering a total of $255 million of protection.The Class A tranche of notes, which have an initial expected loss of 1.41% base for the northeast U.S. named storm risks and 0.98% for the Australian, Canadian and UK mortality risks, were priced at at 5%, towards the lower end of guidance, we understand.While the Class B notes, with an expected loss at the base case of 2.76% base, have priced at 6.5%, we believe, the lower-end of initial guidance.Now completed Swiss Re has $855 million of retrocessional reinsurance protection in-force from the Matterhorn Re catastrophe bond program.We understand the Class A tranche will cover Swiss Re until the end of 2023, so almost four years, while the Class B notes are on-risk only until just after the end of the November 2021, so covering two U.S. hurricane seasons.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The resulting collateral will be used to collateralise reinsurance agreements for the firm.As in all previous Vitality Re ILS transactions, Aetna Life Insurance Company will enter into a quota share health reinsurance agreement with Vermont captive Health Re Inc., and Health Re will in turn enter into an excess of loss reinsurance agreement for each tranche of notes with Vitality Re XI.As in other Vitality Re health ILS’, the coverage is really an annual aggregate indemnity reinsurance arrangement.The specific trigger that could cause a payout from the Vitality Re XI notes is based on an index of Aetna’s medical benefit claims ratio. If the index rises above a predefined attachment point level for either of the tranches it would trigger a payment.Coverage will be across four annual risk periods running to the end of 2023, we’re told.As a result, the indemnity like protection covers medical benefit claims rate inflation risk for Aetna.For this 2020 deal, Vitality Re XI Ltd. will issue a $140 million tranche of Class A notes and a $60 million tranche of Class B notes, with both covering remote layers of risk within Aetna’s health insurance book.The $140 million of Vitality Re XI Class A notes will cover Aetna for losses above a medical benefit claims ratio of 102%, equivalent to a $1.02 billion loss level, which gives them an expected loss of less than 0.01%.Given their risk remote nature, the Class A notes are offered to ILS investors with price guidance in a range from 1.75% to 2.25%, we understand.The $60 million of Vitality Re XI Class B notes will cover Aetna for losses above a medical benefit claims ratio of 96%, equivalent to a $960 million loss level, which gives them an expected loss of 0.04%.Also risk remote nature, the Class B notes are offered to ILS investors with price guidance in a range from 2% to 2.75%, we understand.The risk levels and pricing are relatively similar to last year’s Vitality Re ILS deal and as these health ILS transactions have never paid out for Aetna, we expect the pricing will be achieved within guidance.Update 1:The price guidance was lowered for both tranches of health ILS notes to be issued by Vitality Re XI.The still $140m Class A tranche, which are the least risky, saw their price guidance reduced from the launch range of 1.75% to 2.25% down to 1.5% to 1.75%.The slightly riskier and still $60m Class B tranche of notes also saw guidance dropping, falling from the launch price guidance range of 2% to 2.75% down to 1.8% to 2%.Update 2:Pricing has now been fixed at the lowest end of the reduced ranges, reflecting a roughly 25% decline from the mid-point of initial guidance for each tranche.The $140m Class A tranche of notes, which are the least risky, saw coupon pricing settle at 1.5%.The slightly riskier $60m tranche of Class B notes saw their coupon pricing settle at 1.8%.These now fixed prices are actually below Aetna’s 2019 Vitality Re transaction, which covered similar risk levels and priced its two tranches at 1.75% and 2%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Given the reach of Nephila’s large ILS portfolio and growing primary property insurance writings, this seems a prudent way to cover the tail risk associated with its activities.The attachment is at $2.35 billion of losses and the exhaustion will be at $3.35 billion, with this cat bond expected to cover at least 10% of the layer of tail risk.We’re told that the $100 million of Stratosphere Re 2020-1 Class A notes will have an initial attachment point of 0.185%, initial expected loss of 0.115% and are being offered to investors with coupon guidance in a range from 2.75% to 3.25%.It’s a relatively remote risk, being the tail component of the State National and Nephila relationship business, but the multiple is high which should make it appealing to the cat bond investor base.The Stratosphere Re cat bond notes are one of a very few cat bonds to have ever achieved an investment grade rating, having received a ‘BBBsf’ rating from Fitch.Update 1:The Stratosphere Re Ltd.

(Series 2020-1) catastrophe bond transaction by 80%, with the issuance now aiming to secure up to $450 million of retrocession for the company.We understand that the Mona Lisa Re 2020-1 Class A tranche has a new target size of $200 million to $250 million, while the price guidance has been narrowed towards the lower-end of the range at 7.5% to 7.75%.We understand that the Class B tranche is targeting an issuance size from $125 million up to $200 million, while the price guidance has also been narrowed slightly towards the lower-end at 8% to 8.5%.Update 2:RenaissanceRe has settled for a 60% upsizing of its latest catastrophe bond, with the Mona Lisa Re Ltd. (Series 2020-1) cat bond transaction now priced at $400 million in size.The Mona Lisa Re 2020-1 Class A tranche of notes has now grown to $250 million, the upper-end of revised size targets, while the coupon price has now been fixed at 7.5%, so the bottom-end of launch guidance.The Class B tranche eventually settled at $150 million, below the up-to $200 million revised target, while the coupon price guidance has been fixed at 8%, which is again the bottom-end of guidance.We’re told that for RenRe the pricing has been important and that investors may have supported a larger Class B tranche at a higher coupon, but the sponsor opted to secure the best pricing execution it could.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

These are likely the states with the highest earthquake risk and greatest concentration of mortgage loans in the investment portfolio.The notes will provide their coverage through a parametric trigger that uses USGS data as its input and on a per-occurrence basis, across a term that is expected to be just under three years but with a single risk period, it seems.If an earthquake occurs in the covered area, the parameters associated with it will be taken and an index derived to identify whether the quake was severe enough to breach the trigger and cause a payout for either tranche of notes.Sierra Ltd. will look to issue and sell to investors the two tranches of notes and the proceeds will be used as collateral to underpin the risk transfer agreements, as insurance or reinsurance capital secured in case of a triggering event occurring, while the investors will be paid a coupon for holding the risk.A Class A tranche of notes is being offered as a $100 million layer of risk, with an attachment probability of 1.77%, an expected loss of 0.79% and a coupon guidance range of 3.25% to 3.75%, we understand.A Class B tranche is targeting $50 million of coverage, across a riskier layer that has an attachment probability of 4.13%, an expected loss of 2.71% and a coupon guidance range of 5.5% to 6.25%.Update 1:The Sierra Ltd. 2019-1 parametric earthquake cat bond for a mortgage investor is targeting an upsized level of coverage, aiming to secure between $185 million and $225 million of capacity for the sponsor.The Class A tranche of notes is now targeting between $125 million and $150 million of coverage and has had its pricing fixed at 3.25%, while the Class B tranche is targeting between $60 million and $75 million of coverage and has tighter price guidance of 5.5% to 5.85%.Update 2:The Sierra Ltd. 2019-1 cat bond successfully increased in size to $225 million, a 50% uplift on the original target for the issuance.At the same time the largest now $150 million Class A tranche of notes, which are the less risky layer with an expected loss of 0.79%, priced at the bottom end of initial coupon guidance, at 3.25%.The $75 million Class B tranche of notes, which are the riskier layer with an expected loss of 2.71%, priced at 5.75% in the end, which is still in the lower half of initial coupon guidance.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2020-1) cat bond double in size while marketing to become a $350 million issuance.The Class A tranche has increased in size to $175 million, while at the same time the coupon pricing has now been fixed at 5.25%, so below the bottom end of initial guidance (an almost 9% fall in pricing from the original mid-point of guidance).The Class B tranche of notes has more than doubled in size to also reach $175 million and the pricing has again fallen to below the initial range, this time quite significantly to a coupon of 7.5% (a more than 10% fall in pricing from the original mid-point of guidance).So for Swiss Re this looks like a very successful catastrophe bond issuance with attractive pricing and execution, as the deal size has doubled while pricing of the Class A and B tranches of notes have fallen by 9% and 10% respectively.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Industry loss data providers PCS and PERILS will provide the reporting roles for the cat bond.Given the potential scale of the transaction and the fact it’s structured across five layers, this Galileo Re 2019-2 cat bond transaction will offer a range of risk and return investment opportunities for cat bond investors.An unsized Class A tranche of notes will provide protection across a $300 million layer attaching at $1.2 billion, giving a base initial expected loss of 7.74% and with the notes offered with price guidance in a range from 15.25% to 15.75%, we’re told.An also unsized Class B tranche will cover a $300 million layer attaching at $1.5 billion, so having an initial expected loss of 4.98% and with the notes offered with price guidance in a range from 11.5% to 12%.A Class C tranche is sized at $250 million, but covers a $300 million layer attaching at $1.8 billion, with an initial expected loss of 3.52% and with the notes offered with price guidance in a range from 9% to 9.5%.A Class D tranche also has a size at $150 million, also covering a $300 million layer attaching at $2.1 billion, with an initial expected loss of 2.54% and offering price guidance in a range from 7.25% to 7.75%.The final Class E tranche is unsized, but covers a larger $500 million layer, attaching at $2.4 billion, with an initial expected loss of 1.69% and offering price guidance in a range from 5.75% to 6.25%.We understand that in order to qualify under the aggregate terms of the transaction events must exceed a $40 million franchise deductible in each case.So in total, this cat bond’s protection will span layers from $1.2 billion up to a final exhaustion at $2.9 billion, which should the sponsor elect to upsize the deal significantly in response to investor demand means as much as a $1.7 billion layer limit could be available.Update 1:AXA XL pulled two of the tranches from this issuance, likely opting for other sources of retrocessional reinsurance. The remaining three tranches now target up to $575 million of protection for the company.The remaining tranches of notes are the Class A tranche, which was launched without a size but is now targeting between $50 million and $75 million of  reinsurance protection for AXA XL companies across a $300 million layer that attaches at $1.2 billion of losses.The Class A notes have a base initial expected loss of 7.74% and were initially offered with price guidance in a range from 15.25% to 15.75%, but this has now been fixed at the top-end, we understand, to pay a coupon of 15.75%.The second remaining tranche is the Class C layer, that was launched at $250 million in size, but we’re told is now aiming for between this and $300 million of reinsurance protection for AXA XL. These notes cover a $300 million layer attaching at $1.8 billion of losses.The Class C notes have an initial expected loss of 3.52% and their price guidance remains unchanged, staying in a range from 9% to 9.5%.The final surviving tranche is Class D, which was launched at a size of $150 million and we’re told still aims to upsize to as much as $200 million. These notes cover a $300 million layer attaching at $2.1 billion.This Class D tranche of notes have an initial expected loss of 2.54% and again the price guidance remains unchanged at this time, remaining in a range from 7.25% to 7.75%.The Class B and Class E tranches, both of which were unsized at launch, have been pulled from the issuance.Update 2:AXA XL eventually settled for $475 million of fully collateralised, multi-year retrocessional reinsurance protection from its latest catastrophe bond.The Class A tranche of notes, which are the riskiest, has now been fixed to provide $75 million of reinsurance protection to AXA XL companies across a $300 million layer that attaches at $1.2 billion of losses, with a base initial expected loss of 7.74% and will pay investors a coupon of 15.75%, which is the top-end of initial guidance.The Class C layer has in the end secured $250 million of reinsurance protection for AXA XL, coming in at the lower-end of size expectations, to cover a $300 million layer attaching at $1.8 billion of losses. They have an initial expected loss of 3.52% and their pricing eventually settled at the mid-point of guidance at 9.25%.The final tranche is Class D, the lowest risk layer, has now settled at a size of $150 million (again the lower end of size ambitions we understand) and will cover a $300 million layer attaching at $2.1 billion. With an initial expected loss of 2.54%, these notes have their pricing set at 7.45%, which is just slightly below the middle of initial guidance.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

This tranche had a higher expected loss of 15.75% and in the end paid investors a 21% coupon equivalent.The 2019-2 cat bond will clearly pay a higher multiple to those who invest in it as a result. Likely a recognition of the losses USAA has borne in recent years and the fact its cat bond backers supported it in paying customer claims.The second tranche of notes is a currently $100 million Class 2 tranche, which will provide USAA with a four-year layer of reinsurance protection.The Class 2 notes have an attachment probability of 9.78%, attaching at $1.073 billion of losses to USAA we understand, which gives them an initial expected loss of 5.87%.The $100 million of Class 2 notes are being offered to investors with coupon price guidance in a range from 11.25% to 12.25%.For comparison, the 2018-2 Residential Re cat bond had a four-year occurrence Class 2 tranche with an expected loss of 6.45% and it settled to pay investors an 11.5% coupon.Again, the pricing of the 2019-2 cat bond looks a step up from that, on a multiple at market basis.As ever, USAA has elected to cover a wide layer of its reinsurance program with each of these cat bond tranches, meaning there is plenty of room to upsize should investor demand support it to do so.Update 1:The riskier, one-year, zero-coupon Class 1 layer of notes has now priced at 77.25%, so a coupon equivalent of 22.75% which is around the middle of guidance. This tranche remained at $50 million in size.The second Class 2 tranche upsized to $110 million we understand. At pricing the coupon of this tranche has been fixed at 11.5%, so towards the lower-end of guidance, but not quite at the bottom.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Munich Re Capital Markets are a joint structuring agent, placement agent and joint manager.","AIR Worldwide","Philippine earthquakes & tropical cyclones","$225m","Modelled loss","NR","Nov 2019","A catastrophe bond for the Philippines has finally come to market, as the World Bank is set to issue on behalf of the country, through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), a $225 million cat bond to secure both earthquake and tropical cyclone insurance coverage on a modelled loss basis.The issuance is taking place under the World Bank’s IBRD Capital-At-Risk Notes program, with two classes of notes set to be issued and sold to investors to collateralize underlying swap agreements that provide the risk transfer and insurance protection to the Republic of the Philippines.Two classes of notes are set to be issued and sold to investors to collateralize underlying swap agreements that provide the risk transfer and reinsurance protection to the Republic of the Philippines, we understand, with one class of notes devoted to coverage for each of the two perils.The World Bank’s IBRD is the issuer, while the Treasury of the Republic of the Philippines is understood to be the beneficiary of an underlying catastrophe swap agreement between it and the Bank that facilitates the protection.The swap agreements are fully collateralised through the sale of the two tranches of notes, providing the capacity to back the disaster risk transfer protection for the Philippines government.Both of the perils coverage will be on a modelled loss basis, using modelling from AIR Worldwide we understand, while the trigger is a per-occurrence structure.The catastrophe bond will provide the Philippines government with a three year source of disaster risk transfer capacity that would pay out should an earthquake or tropical cyclone event breach the modelled loss triggers parameters during the term.Depending on the calculated modelled loss amount following any earthquake or tropical cyclone event, the outstanding principal of either tranche may be reduced by 0%, 35%, 70%, or 100%. Hence the severity of a catastrophe will denote how large a payout comes due.The first tranche features currently $75 million of IBRD CAR 123 Class A notes that will be exposed to Philippine earthquake risks.We’re told this earthquake risk tranche will have an attachment probability of 5.3% and an expected loss of 3%, while the notes are to be offered to ILS investors with a risk margin (spread) of between 5% and 5.75%.The second tranche features currently $150 million of IBRD CAR 124 Class B notes that will be exposed to Philippine tropical cyclone risks.This tranche, we understand, has an attachment probability of 5.3% and an expected loss of 3%, with the notes offered to investors with a risk margin of between 5.2% and 6%.Both tranches will cover the entirety of the Philippines and represent the first 144a catastrophe bonds to have exposure to the country.Update 1:After marketing, we understand that this first Philippines catastrophe bond looks destined to complete at the original $225 million size, despite having been marketed as up to $300 million to potential investors.Update 2:The pricing was fixed with both tranches of notes settling with a risk margin fixed within the upper-half of guidance ranges.The first tranche of $75 million IBRD CAR 123 Class A notes, that will be exposed to Philippine earthquake risks, have an initial expected loss of 3% and were offered to ILS investors with a risk margin (spread) of between 5% and 5.75%. This tranche priced with the risk margin at 5.5%, so in the upper-half of guidance.The second tranche of $150 million IBRD CAR 124 Class B notes, exposed to Philippine tropical cyclone risk, have an initial expected loss of 3% and were offered to investors with a risk margin of between 5.25% and 6%. This tranche priced with the risk margin fixed at 5.65%, which is only slightly above the mid-point.Update – December 22nd, 2021:The Philippines Government Treasury department issued a notice to the calculation agent requesting that an assessment be made as to whether recent super typhoon Rai (locally known as Odette) might have triggered its World Bank issued catastrophe bond coverage.Update – January 24th, 2022:The Philippines government will make a recovery under the terms of its World Bank issued catastrophe bond, as we’ve learned that the event calculation process has now run and super typhoon Rai (locally known as Odette) has breached the parametric trigger for wind.We can report that this tranche of notes faces at least a 35% payout of principal, or US $52.5 million of the $150 million tropical cyclone exposed Class B notes, after the calculation agent AIR ran its models and the event parameters breached the trigger, activating the lowest level of payout. Calculation for precipitation is ongoing, meaning the loss of principal could potentially increase.As a result, the Class B tropical cyclone exposed notes are now reduced to $97.5 million in principal outstanding, after the recovery.Update – April 19th 2022:The Bureau of the Treasury of the Republic of the Philippines has issued another notice to the calculation agent of this cat bond after the impacts of April’s tropical storm Megi (locally known as storm Agaton).Storm Megi did not achieve typhoon strength, but its rains were particularly impactful and deadly, hence the calculation process will now be run to derive whether the modelled loss from this tropical cyclone would trigger the notes again.Update – May 16th 2022:A calculation process that has been ongoing for the rainfall from typhoon Rai (locally known as Odette) has now completed and no additional reduction in principal was triggered.The calculation process for Megi continues at this time.Update – May 23rd 2022:The calculation agent has found that the winds from tropical storm Megi, that struck the Philippines in April 2022, had not been sufficiently severe to breach the catastrophe bond trigger and result in any additional payout for the Government.The calculation process for Megi’s rainfall will continue, but could take some months based on how long it took for typhoon Rai.Update  – Sept 10th 2022:We learned that after running the calculation process for storm Megi (Agaton) rainfall, the calculation agent found that they were not severe enough to trigger the cat bond notes, with no additional payout due.Update – Sept 26th 2022:Super typhoon Noru (locally known as Karding) made landfall in Luzon, northern Philippines over the weekend and early indications are that it will definitely be an event that requires another run of the calculation process for the Philippines government’s World Bank cat bond, with one cat bond fund manager saying they feel it’s likely to default again as a result of the storm.It’s impossible to know how large a default this could be, as with the percentage based scale it could be 0%, 35%, 70%, or 100% of the remaining $97.5 million in principal outstanding from the Class B tropical cyclone exposed notes.Update – Oct 10th 2022:We’ve now learned that an event notice had been officially submitted for super typhoon Noru (Karding) by the Philippines government. Risk modeller Verisk will now run the documented calculation agent process and report back to the Bureau of the Treasury, as well as to investors in the catastrophe bond, whether any payout of principal is due for the storm.Update – Feb 2023:The remaining $97.5m of notes from the Philippines cat bond were not exposed to any losses due to typhoon Noru and so the issuance matured.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Given that’s a €300 million layer of the insurers reinsurance program, there is plenty of room for the transaction to be upsized if investors demand is there to support it.We’re told that this equates to a 5.9% attachment probability and a 3.65% expected loss.The Hexagon II Reinsurance notes are being offered to investors with price guidance in a range from 5.15% to 5.65%, suggesting a multiple at market of around 1.5% at the mid-point of this range.We understand the transaction will likely settle at the beginning of November, giving plenty of time for investor meetings and marketing to be undertaken.Update 1:We understand that this Hexagon II Re 2019-1 catastrophe bond is likely to upsize slightly to between €110 million and €130 million, while at the same time the pricing guidance has been reduced to the lowest end of the range at 5.15%.Update 2:In the end the Hexagon II Re 2019-1 catastrophe bond did upsize but only to €120 million, a 20% increase on the launch size of the deal.The €120 million of notes saw their pricing settle at the lowest-end of guidance, at 5.15%, which is an almost 5% reduction in pricing from the mid-point of initial guidance. This coupon represents a multiple at market of around 1.41 times the base case expected loss of 3.65%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Bellemeade Re 2019-3 Ltd.","Bellemeade Re 2019-3 Ltd.","Arch Capital Group Ltd.","?","N/A","Mortgage insurance risks","$700.92m","Indemnity","Morningstar: M-1A - "AAA"; M-1B - "AA-"; M-1C - "A-"; B-1 - "BBB+"","Jul 2019","Arch Capital is looking to expand its capital markets backed mortgage reinsurance protection with its third mortgage insurance-linked securities (ILS) transaction of the year.Bellemeade Re 2019-3 Ltd. has been established in Bermuda for the purpose of issuing four tranches of mortgage insurance-linked notes, that will be sold to investors and the proceeds used to collateralize underlying reinsurance agreements between the issuer and Arch Capital.With a targeted issuance size of $700.92 million, this Bellemeade Re 2019-3 mortgage ILS transaction will be the largest from Arch to-date and also the largest mortgage ILS transaction we’ve recorded so far (details on all the mortgage ILS we’ve covered can be found here).The Bellemeade Re 2019-3 mortgage ILS transaction is also set to be the highest rated ever seen, with the most senior tranche of notes having a triple-A rating from Morningstar.As a result, that is in fact the highest rated tranche of ILS notes that provide reinsurance protection ever, as ILS and catastrophe bonds are typically much lower rated due to their ratings being linked to the catastrophe risks they usually carry.This is the seventh rated transaction from Arch subsidiaries, the eighth mortgage ILS deal under the Bellemeade Re name in total.Rating agency Morningstar gave more details on the fundamentals of the transaction:Bellemeade Re 2019-3 Ltd. is backed by reinsurance premiums and related account investment earnings and reversionary interests, in each case relating to a pool of mortgage-insurance policies linked to residential loans. The residential mortgage loans are insured against certain losses by mortgage insurance policies that are in turn subject to the coverage by the reinsurance agreement. The pool of insured mortgage loans consists of fully amortizing, fixed- and variable-rate, first-lien loans. The pool is geographically diverse, with the largest state concentration in Texas at approximately 7.7% of the unpaid principal balance.The balance of the insured mortgage loans covered by the policies is $49.62 billion, and the aggregate of the exposed principal balance associated with the mortgage-insurance policy coverage is $9.28 billion. Of this, reinsurance provided by the issuer equals the offered balance of $700.9 million, which consists of Classes M-1A, M-1B, M-1C, and B-1. The offered notes are exposed to the risk of reinsured losses on the mortgage-insurance policies issued by Arch Mortgage Insurance Co. and United Guaranty Residential Insurance Co., the ceding insurers.The transaction is split into $222.809 million of Class M-1A notes that are rated AAA by Morningstar, $$278.511 million of Class M-1B notes rated AA-, $$176.39 million of Class M-1C notes rated A-, and $$23.21 million of Class B-1 notes that are rated BBB+.One of the factors that may have influenced the higher rating of the most senior tranche of notes in this mortgage ILS transaction is that with the mortgage loans covered by the subject insurance having been seasoned for an average of 33 months, the value of the properties covered have increased quite significantly since the loans were taken out.This reduces the risk of claims on the subject mortgage insurance policies.As a result, the Morningstar loan to value ratio is lower than on other recently rated mortgage insurance-linked notes deals, resulting in lower defaults and claims payouts under the analysis of the deal.Each of the tranches of notes issued will have ten-year final maturities set for July 2029.Update 1:Commenting on the successful issuance, Jim Bennison, EVP, Alternative Markets for Arch Capital Group (U.S.) Inc., explained, “Since the inception of the Bellemeade ILN program, one of our goals has been to transfer a portion of the risk across the entire U.S. mortgage insurance portfolio, which we’ve now largely achieved.“With over four billion dollars of aggregate reinsurance protection on our portfolio, we believe we’re at the forefront of managing capital and risk in the mortgage insurance industry.”Arch noted the transaction is the “the largest individual ILN ever conducted by a mortgage insurance company.”The deal provides Arch with exactly $700,920,000 of indemnity reinsurance on a pool representing $49.6 billion of mortgages, with the portfolio of MI policies linked to 219,994 loans issued by Arch MI and affiliates in 2016.Arch also disclosed the pricing of the four tranches of mortgage insurance-linked notes, explaining that the $222.809 million of class M-1A notes priced with a coupon of one-month LIBOR plus 110 basis points, the $278.511 million of class M-1B notes at LIBOR plus 160 basis points, the $176.39 million of class M-1C notes at LIBOR plus 195 basis points, and the $23.21 million of class B-1 notes priced at LIBOR plus 250 basis points.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Puerto Rico & Virgin Islands), U.S. & Canada earthquake, European windstorm","$165m","Industry loss index","NR","Jun 2019","Insurance and reinsurance firm AXIS Capital has returned to the capital markets to sponsor what will be its fourth catastrophe bond, as the company seeks to expand its sources of retrocessional reinsurance capacity by tapping ILS investor appetite.Using its Northshore Re II Ltd. special purpose insurance vehicle again, which it used for previous $350 million Northshore Re II Ltd. (Series 2017-1) and a $200 million Northshore Re II Ltd. (Series 2018-1) deals, AXIS is seeking a very similar type of coverage and an expansion to its retrocession and reinsurance program, we’re told.Northshore Re II Ltd. will seek to issue a single tranche of Series 2019-1 notes that are currently sized at $100 million, with the notes set to be offered to cat bond investors and the proceeds from their sale used to collateralize a retrocessional reinsurance agreement with the company.The coverage will benefit AXIS’ subsidiaries, including its Lloyd’s syndicate, insurance and reinsurance companies, so effectively provide broad coverage for AXIS’ property catastrophe exposure in peak zones.The notes will provide AXIS with four years of collateralized reinsurance and retrocession protection against certain losses from U.S. named storms (including in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands), U.S. & Canada earthquakes and European windstorm catastrophe events.The protection will be on an annual aggregate basis, across the four annual risk periods, and the cat bond features industry loss triggers for each covered peril that will be weighted on a state, regional or localised basis from PCS for the U.S. risks and PERILS for EU windstorm risks.The currently $100 million of notes, which we’d imagine stand a good chance of upsizing, will have an initial attachment probability of 3.3% and an initial expected loss of 2.84%, we understand.The trigger features an index franchise deductible for each loss event, after which the qualifying losses will aggregate upwards across the year as index points towards an attachment level for the notes, where they would begin to see losses.The notes are being offered to ILS investors with pricing guidance in a range from 7.75% to 8.25%, we understand, providing room for a reasonable multiple that is aligned with other recent transactions.In fact the multiple looks much higher than AXIS’ 2018 Northshore Re II cat bond, which with an initial expected loss of 4.47% being riskier than this deal, priced at just 7.75%.So this Northshore Re II 2019-1 catastrophe bond from AXIS Capital should offer investors a better return, in terms of multiple at least, for taking on its exposure than the previous transaction that was issued only one-year ago.Update 1:The Northshore Re II 2019-1 catastrophe bond from AXIS was well-received by investors and upsized by 65% to reach $165 million at pricing.At the same time the cat bond issuance priced below the low-end of guidance, to offer investors a coupon of 7.5%.

The pool is geographically diverse, with the largest state concentration in California at approximately 9.3% of the unpaid principal balance. The offered notes are exposed to the risk of reinsured losses on the mortgage-insurance policies issued by Essent Guaranty, Inc., the ceding insurer.”The covered mortgage loans are seasoned by an average of 38 months, with 97.7% of loans always current and not reported as delinquent.Essent Guaranty said that the Radnor Re 2019-2 mortgage ILS secures it $333.8 million of fully collateralized excess of loss reinsurance coverage.The reinsurance specifically covers a portfolio of mortgage insurance policies underwritten by Essent in 2015 and 2016.The issuance featured: a $125.734 million tranche of Class M-1A Notes, which will pay investors interest of one-month LIBOR plus 1.2%; a $186.432 million Class M-1B tranche of Notes which pay interest of LIBOR plus 1.75%; and $21.678 million of Class B-1 Notes with initial interest of LIBOR plus 2.7%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2019-1) cat bond transaction, as it expanded its use of the capital markets for reinsurance protection.The NCIUA has now returned for a $100 million top-up to its catastrophe bond backed reinsurance protection, with this Cape Lookout Re 2019-2 transaction which is a riskier layer of its program.This $100 million Cape Lookout Re 2019-2 catastrophe bond again sees the NCIUA working alongside reinsurance firm Hannover Re who will front the capital markets on its behalf, seeking what is effectively an extension to the coverage provided by the first Cape Lookout Re deal, given the similarity of coverage and terms.The cat bond is slated to provide the Association with a $100 million or greater source of fully collateralized reinsurance protection, on an indemnity and annual aggregate basis across a three-year term.The coverage is for certain losses from named storms and severe thunderstorms to the NCIUA’s portfolio in the state of North Carolina.Cape Lookout Re Ltd., a Bermuda special purpose insurer, will issue a single $100 million tranche of Series 2019-2 Class A cat bond notes which will be sold to capital market investors and the proceeds used to collateralize the NCIUA’s underlying reinsurance needs.The reinsurance will be serviced via Hannover Re, acting as the ceding reinsurer. The German reinsurance firm will enter into a reinsurance agreement with the NCIUA and a retrocession agreement with Cape Lookout Re Ltd., to complete the financing of the coverage and the transfer of the risks.While the coverage details are the same, the risk level associated with this second Cape Lookout Re cat bond of 2019 is very different.The 2019-1 issuance attached at $1.75 billion of losses to the NCIUA, covering a percentage of losses up to $2.25 billion.This new 2019-2 cat bond is slated to attach below that at $1.3 billion of losses to the NCIUA, covering a $300 million layer up to $1.6 billion. That leaves room for this cat bond to increase in size from the $100 million launch, should investor appetite prove strong and pricing attractive.As a result, the initial expected loss of the $100 million of Series 2019-2 notes to be issued by Cape Lookout Re is 2.52%, while the price guidance is put in a range from 6.75% to 7.75%.For comparison, the 2019-1 lower risk notes had an initial expected loss of 1.61% and priced at 4.25%.Update 1:The issuance remained at $100 million in size and the pricing settled at the low-end of guidance, to offer investors a 6.75% coupon.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2013-1).So it’s very encouraging to learn that Swiss Re has not given up on the catastrophe bond market and sees value in sponsoring new transactions this year.For this issuance Swiss Re will be using a new cat bond vehicle for the first time.Matterhorn Re Ltd. was registered as a Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurer and segregated accounts company in late 2018 and for this first issuance under the vehicle, a single tranche of Series 2019-1 notes will be issued and sold to ILS investors, with the resulting proceeds set to collateralize a retrocessional reinsurance agreement between Matterhorn Re and Swiss Re.The notes are being termed SR2019-1 by the issuer, we understand, to denote Swiss Re as the sponsor of this transaction.Matterhorn Re has been marketed as a $100 million transaction to begin, with investor interest currently being sought for the deal and its resulting notes.We understand the $100 million of Matterhorn Re Series 2019-1 notes will provide Swiss Re with a source of collateralized retro reinsurance against certain losses from northeast U.S. named storms, on an industry loss trigger and per-occurrence basis.The covered area includes the U.S. states of Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia, we’re told.The Matterhorn Re notes could be triggered when a PCS reported industry loss for a named storm affecting the northeastern U.S. states rises above an index attachment point of $17.5 billion, covering losses up to an index exhaustion point at $25 billion, we’re told. That’s equivalent to an attachment probability of 2.38% in the first year.This Matterhorn Re cat bond will have a tenure of roughly 18 months, so providing Swiss Re with retrocessional reinsurance protection across two U.S. hurricane seasons, with maturity slated for November 20th 2020.The Matterhorn Re notes are being issued at a discount to par, so akin to a zero coupon arrangement.The notes have a one-year modelled expected loss of 1.92% and across the entire 18 month term it would be 3.81%.We understand that the pricing guidance pegs the notes at between 90.5% to 91.5% of par value, which could be considered similar to an 8.5% to 9.5% coupon range for them.Update 1:The Matterhorn Re 2019-1 cat bond from Swiss Re upsized by 150% while marketing, to issue $250 million of notes.At the same time the pricing dropped to the tight-end of guidance, or 91.5% of par value, so a coupon equivalent of 8.5% over the term of the cat bond deal.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

In addition, none of the loans covered by the insurance policies have ever been reported as delinquent.The insured loans have a weighted average seasoning of 6 months, being relatively newly issued in the last year and a half, while the risk levels sit in the range covered by other mortgage ILS transactions we’ve seen and reported on.MGIC said that each of the three tranches of 10-year maturity mortgage insurance-linked notes that are being issued by Home Re 2019-1 Ltd. have now been priced successfully.The Class M-1 tranche (the lowest risk) has been priced with an initial interest spread of one-month LIBOR plus 165 basis points. The Class M-2 tranche has been priced at one-month LIBOR plus 325 basis points. While the riskiest Class B-1 tranche of notes has been priced at one-month LIBOR plus 435 basis points.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Ltd. has been established as a special purpose reinsurance vehicle registered in Singapore and will seek to issue a single tranche of Series 2019-1 cat bond notes, that will be sold to investors to provide Safepoint with a source of collateralised reinsurance capacity.The SPRV will seek to issue a single tranche of Series 2019-1 cat bond notes, that will be sold to investors to provide Safepoint with a source of collateralised reinsurance capacity.We’re told the Manatee Re III cat bond issuance is targeting at least $75 million of reinsurance protection for sponsor Safepoint, with two tranches of notes set to be sold to provide the collateral to underpin the reinsurance contracts.The Manatee Re III Pte. 2019 cat bond will provide sponsor Safepoint with a source of indemnity based reinsurance across a three-year term, providing cascading and per-occurrence coverage against losses from named storms and severe thunderstorms in Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey & Texas.We’re told the cat bond coverage area could be expanded, should Safepoint grow into further U.S. states during the period of coverage, so providing flexible reinsurance that can support the companies ongoing expansion and growth.Manatee Re III Pte. Ltd. is going to issue two tranches of notes, both of which are exposed to the perils above but at different risk levels.A currently $50 million tranche of Series 2019-1 Class A notes will have an initial attachment point of $27 million and cover a layer right up to $377 million, we understand, with an initial expected loss of 1.15%. This tranche is to be offered to investors with pricing guidance of 4.5% to 5%.A $25 million tranche of Series 2019-1 Class B notes will have an initial attachment also at $27 million, covering a layer up to $107 million, with an initial expected loss of 4.23%, so sitting below the Class A notes and being more risky as a result. This tranche has price guidance of 8.75% to 9.25%, we’re told.We understand that Safepoint will seek as much capital markets reinsurance protection as it can secure with this new cat bond, filling the rest of these layers with other traditional or collateralised sources of reinsurance as is necessary following the execution of this transaction.Each tranche will sit alongside Safepoint’s 2018 Manatee Re II Ltd. catastrophe bond.Update 1:The Manatee Re III Pte. Ltd. (Series 2019-1) transaction which is being issued out of Singapore, looks set for pricing above the initial guidance range, as investors demand more return for the risk they are taking on.The first tranche of Series 2019-1 Class A notes had been targeting $50 million, but this we’re now told is targeting a $20 million to $40 million tranche of notes.The Class A notes have an initial expected loss of 1.15% and were at first offered to investors with pricing guidance of 4.5% to 5%, but we’re now told the guidance has risen to 5.25%, so above the initial range.The second tranche of Series 2019-1 Class B notes began targeting $25 million of reinsurance coverage for Safepoint and we’re told are still aiming for that, with a proposed $20 million to $30 million sizing.With an initial expected loss of 4.23%, the Class B tranche notes will sit below the Class A notes, being more risky as a result. This layer was initially offered to investors with price guidance of 8.75% to 9.25%, but we’re now told the coupon has risen to above that range at 9.5%.The increase in pricing is a sign of reinsurance market conditions for the Florida region at these renewals, after excessive losses and loss adjustment expenses totaled many insurers protection in the prior years.Update 2:At pricing the size of the Manatee Re III catastrophe bond shrank, achieving just $40 million of the reinsurance coverage that sponsor Safepoint had been seeking.The final pricing was at the elevated above guidance levels of 5.25% for the now $20 million of Class A notes and 9.5% for the $20 million of Class B notes.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

These notes are offered to investors with price guidance ranging from 7.75% to 8.5%.The second tranche, a Class 13 set of notes, attaching at $2.675 billion of losses to the sponsor and so are less risky with an initial expected loss of 0.98%. These are offered with price guidance in a range from 4% to 4.5%, we’re told.This second tranche is actually a little higher risk than a Class 13 tranche of notes from one of USAA’s 2018 catastrophe bond deals which was priced with a coupon of 3.25%.So the indicative guide pricing of this latest cat bond from the insurer looks like it may seek to compensate investors for some of the losses they have taken in recent years and reflect slightly higher risk-adjusted pricing.Update 1:The Class 12 tranche of notes have now been sized at $60 million, we understand. This is the riskier layer in the transaction, with an initial expected loss of 3.61%. These notes were offered to investors with initial price guidance ranging from 7.75% to 8.5% and we’re told pricing looks set to settle at 8.25%, so just below the upper-end.The second tranche, a Class 13 set of notes, has now been sized at $75 million.

(UPC), Family Security Insurance Co., Interboro Insurance Co., and American Coastal Insurance.This will be United’s largest catastrophe bond to-date and is double the size of its $100 million Armor Re II Ltd. (Series 2018-1) transaction.Armor Re II Ltd. will seek to issue two tranches of Series 2019-1 notes in this deal, with both tranches targeting $100 million or more in terms of reinsurance coverage for the insurer.The notes from each tranche will be sold to ILS investors, with the resulting proceeds set to be used to collateralize underlying reinsurance agreements between the SPI and United itself.In the same way as the 2018 transaction, the Armor Re II 2019-1 notes will provide United and its subsidiaries with a source of collateralized and multi-year reinsurance across a three-year term, on an indemnity trigger and per-occurrence basis.We’re told the coverage will cascade as well, as does the 2018 Armor Re II cat bond protection, meaning the attachment level for each tranche of notes can adjust during an annual risk period, as qualifying loss events erode any other layers of reinsurance protection that inure to the benefit of this cat bond.The reinsurance protection that United’s insurer subsidiaries will receive from the Armor Re II 2019 cat bond deal will be for certain losses caused by U.S. named storm and earthquake events, so the same as the 2018 transaction.The coverage area is for across all the states where United (UPC) operates, so Florida, the east and gulf coasts are included for named storm risks, while quake reinsurance cover will be for all quake exposed states United’s subsidiaries currently operate in.Both tranches of notes from this Armor Re II 2019-1 cat bond will sit below the 2018 transaction and atop United’s inuring traditional catastrophe reinsurance layer.The first currently $100 million Class A tranche of Series 2019-1 notes will have an initial expected loss of 1.64% and attach after a $26 million retention, the $1.039 billion of inuring traditional reinsurance and the $100 million Class B tranche are all eroded.The second currently $100 million Class B tranche will have an initial expected loss of 2.08% and attach after the $26 million retention and the $1.039 billion of traditional reinsurance erode.Both of these tranches cover a $200 million layer of risk, so it looks like there is room for this latest cat bond from United to upsize considerably, to as much as $400 million, should investor appetite allow.As a result, the Class A tranche of Armor Re II Series 2019-1 cat bond notes are being offered to investors with price guidance in a range from 5.4% to 5.9%, while the riskier Class B tranche of notes are offered at 5.9% to 6.4%.Update 1:It looks like the Armor Re II 2019-1 catastrophe bond has been slashed in half, as the Class B higher risk tranche has now disappeared from the issuance, we’re told.Meanwhile, the Class A tranche of notes remained at $100 million in size and the pricing moved to the top-end of guidance, at 5.9%.That implies a multiple which if replicated for the Class B notes would have taken their pricing far above the marketed range. As a result we suspect this layer will have been placed either traditionally, or as a collateralized reinsurance arrangement and possibly only on a one-year basis.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Morningstar has rated the notes: M-1A – “A”; M-1B – “A1”; M-1C – “BBB-“; M-2 – “BB-“; B-1 – “BB-“.The transaction will cover a percentage of the risk for a pool of relatively recently originated mortgage-insurance policies linked to residential loans, none of which have been reported as in default as of the cut-off date.“The balance of the insured mortgage loans covered by the policies is $35.58 billion, and the aggregate of the mortgage-insurance policy coverage amount is $8.87 billion,” rating agency Morningstar explained.The reinsurance provided by Bellemeade Re 2019-2 will provide indemnity based protection for $621 million of the mortgage insurance policy coverage amount, while the remainder will either be retained by Arch Capital or perhaps traditional reinsured alongside this latest mortgage ILS deal.The $621 million of mortgage ILS notes issued by Bellemeade Re 2019-2 will be exposed to the risk of reinsured losses on the portfolio of mortgage insurance policies. The policies have all been issued by Arch Mortgage Insurance Co. and United Guaranty Residential Insurance Co., which are the ceding insurers for the purposes of the transaction.The riskiest tranche of notes have a lower attachment point than the previous Bellemeade Re deal, while the portfolio of mortgage loans have been seasoned for fewer months than recent mortgage ILS deals.It’s a stark contrast to Arch’s previous mortgage ILS deal, which featured much older mortgage insurance policies, with much longer seasoning term.This is now Arch Capital Group’s eighth issuance of mortgage insurance-linked securities (or insurance-linked notes) under the Bellemeade Re series of transactions. Including this new $621 million arrangement, Arch Capital will have ceded $3.46 billion of mortgage insurance risks to capital market investors, providing significant reinsurance coverage to its rapidly expanding mortgage book.Including this latest Bellemeade ILS transaction, which is Arch’s 8th in the series, the company has benefitted from aggregate reinsurance coverage of approximately $3.5 billion through the capital markets deals.Bellemeade Re 2019-2 Ltd. has issued and sold five classes of amortizing notes with 10-year legal final maturities to capital market investors, with the proceeds from the sale collateralizing the underlying reinsurance obligations between the special purpose insurer (SPI) and Arch.The transaction featured five classes of notes:Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Hannover Re ultimately provides the reinsurance coverage to FEMA and its National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).This 2019 flood cat bond issuance features a $250 million Class A tranche of Series 2019-1 notes and a $50 million Class B tranche, which are the more risky layer of the issuance.Both tranches of Flood Smart Re 2019-1 notes will be exposed over a three-year term to qualifying losses from flood events that are caused by named storms, the same covered peril as the 2018 flood cat bond deal.Coverage is on an indemnity and per-occurrence basis and this cat bond will protect FEMA against certain NFIP losses across the United States, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and D.C., we understand.Covering named storm related flood events only means this is protecting the NFIP against the true peak catastrophe events that it faces, as the largest flood insurance losses in its history have been tropical storm and hurricane linked.This new FloodSmart 2019 cat bond will sit in a vertical slice of the higher layers of the NFIP’s reinsurance tower, alongside the 2018 cat bond and the two higher layers of FEMA’s 2019 flood reinsurance arrangements.The proposed $250 million Class A tranche of FloodSmart Re Series 2019-1 notes will sit alongside the highest layer of FEMA’s NFIP reinsurance , we understand. These notes would attach at $8 billion of losses to the NFIP and exhaust at $10 billion, which we’re told give the notes an initial expected loss of 4.15% and attachment probability of 4.93%. This tranche is being offered to investors with coupon guidance in a range from 10.25% to 11.25%, sources said.The smaller $50 million of Class B notes that FloodSmart Re is proposing to issue will sit alongside the second layer of the NFIP reinsurance program, so attaching at $6 billion of losses and covering up to $8 billion. That gives the notes an initial expected loss of 6.01% and attachment probability of 7.31%, while the coupon guidance is set in a range from 13.5% to 14.5%, we’re told.In terms of pricing, these ranges are roughly similar to the 2018 cat bond, although have room for pricing to settle very slightly higher it appears.Update 1:FEMA’s new FloodSmart Re 2019 catastrophe bond has remained at $300 million in size, with both tranches staying static in dollar terms.However, the pricing has now been fixed for both and the $250 million Class A tranche of notes (the less risky layer) is set to price at the upper-end of guidance at 11.25%, while the $50 million higher risk Class B tranche priced is also set to price at the top-end of guidance at 14.5%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The historical performance on these loans and other similar agency loans has been strong. As of the cutoff date, the loans in the pool have never been reported to the ceding insurer as being more than 60-days delinquent, according to the ceding insurer. No mortgage loan has ever been modified as of the cutoff date. None of the loans are interest-only, and all loans have full documentation.”It’s worth noting thought that the average seasoning of the mortgage loans is relatively low, at just 5 months. This is the second lowest seen in a mortgage ILS deal, after Arch’s last Bellemeade Re.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2019-1) transaction.This is the fourth year in a row that State Farm has sought additional collateralized earthquake reinsurance protection from the capital markets in a privately syndicated catastrophe bond issuance.This deal will have been privately marketed to a select group of insurance-linked securities (ILS) funds and investors, using a syndicated approach but not marketed to the entire ILS investor community, hence details of the transaction are somewhat limited.For its latest cat bond State Farm has registered a new special purpose insurer in Bermuda, named Merna Re II Ltd.Merna Re II Ltd. has issued a single tranche featuring $300 million of Series 2019-1 Class A notes which have been sold to ILS investors, with the funds raised used to collateralize a trust to support a reinsurance agreement between Merna Re II and State Farm.We’re told the reinsurance coverage this cat bond provides State Farm is for U.S. earthquake exposures, however we do not know if this is country-wide, or just the New Madrid zone, as many of the previous Merna Re cat bonds have been focused on.The reinsurance coverage that State Farm benefits from with this Merna Re II cat bond will run for a three-year term, we understand, with maturity due April 7th 2022.We assume the private syndication of these Merna Re II notes was so as to keep State Farm’s costs of issuance and reinsurance as low as possible, by utilising a private club type deal.This $300 million Merna Re II 2019-1 cat bond will utilise an indemnity trigger, as State Farm’s cat bond coverage tends to provide the insurer with a source of indemnity based reinsurance protection.The fully collateralized reinsurance protection that State Farm benefits from with this new Merna Re II 2019 cat bond deal will serve to replace that provided by the soon to mature $300 million Merna Re 2016-1 transaction.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Both will cover a $100 million layer, suggesting this tranche could double in size if Allstate wanted it to and ILS investor demand responds.The Class A tranche has an initial expected loss of just slightly under 1% combined across the two sections of coverage, with price guidance targeted in a range from 4% to 4.5%.The currently $300 million Class B tranche of notes would attach on an occurrence basis at the same $2.75 billion of losses and aggregate basis at $3.54 billion, we understand. But this tranche will cover a $400 million layer of Allstate’s reinsurance tower, suggesting it could grow if Allstate elects toThe Class B tranche has an initial expected loss of just slightly under 1.57% combined across the two sections of coverage, with price guidance targeted in a range from 11.25% to 12.25%.The Class B tranche is much more exposed to the annual aggregate catastrophe risk in this cat bond, while the occurrence attachment probability is the same for both tranches of notes.The design of the structure will provide useful reinsurance protection to Allstate, slotting neatly into its tower alongside its traditional layers of protection and being available to respond to large single catastrophe loss events as well as attrition caused by multiple smaller losses.Update 1:We understand that the less risky $50 million Class A tranche of notes from Allstate’s latest catastrophe bond was pulled from this issuance.The $300 million Class B tranche was priced with no increase in size and at the upper-end of the initial spread guidance (11.25% to 12.25%), so will offer ILS investors a 12.25% coupon.Update – Mar 18 2021:Following a significant winter storm and deep freeze event in Texas, Allstate said that thanks to gross losses of around $1.3 billion its aggregate catastrophe losses had surpassed its retention on its nationwide aggregate reinsurance tower.The coverage of that nationwide aggregate reinsurance tower is provided by Allstate’s Sanders Re catastrophe bonds, in particular the ones providing both occurrence and aggregate protection.This Sanders Re II 2019-1 catastrophe bond sits lowest down in the aggregate tower, meaning it faces some losses.As of the time of writing, broker pricing sheets had the $300m of notes issues in this cat bond deal marked down at between 10 and 20 cents on the dollar, implying up to a 90% loss of principal, which could be as much as $270m.Update – May 6th 2021:The erosion of principal for investors in this cat bond continued, now amounting to $195 million, leaving just $105 million of coverage from this cat bond to cover future losses or loss creep.Update – August 5th 2021:Erosion of this $300 million of catastrophe bond notes issued by Sanders Re II in 2019 continued in the second-quarter of 2021, with now $253 million of the principal eroded and just $47 million of the coverage remaining, as of the end of June.The continued erosion was due to loss creep on first-quarter catastrophe events, predominantly the Texas freeze, we believe.Update – Feb 2022:It became clear that Allstate has booked a full recovery from this catastrophe bond, so is expecting the full $300m of principal to be paid out after ongoing loss creep from events affecting the 2020/21 aggregate loss period, which again we believe to have been predominantly the winter storm Uri and Texas freeze loss.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The residential mortgage loans are insured against certain losses by mortgage insurance policies that are in turn subject to the coverage provided by the reinsurance agreement. The pool of insured mortgage loans consists of fully amortizing, fixed- and variable-rate first-lien loans that are not in default as of the cutoff date. Approximately 49.1% of the insured mortgage loans are modified. For approximately 38.3% of the insured mortgage loans, the ceding insurer has entered into settlement agreement, wherein the ceding insurer is restricted from denying or curtailing claims or terminating coverage on the basis of most origination defects and servicing-related conduct. The pool of insured mortgage loans is significantly seasoned, and approximately 88.2% of the mortgage loans have been performing for at least 24 months. The pool is geographically diverse, with the largest state concentration in Florida at approximately 7.3% of the balance.”The insured mortgage loans covered by these policies amount to $22.97 billion, and the aggregate of the mortgage-insurance policy coverage amount is $5.94 billion, with the notes to be issued set to provide a slice of reinsurance from the capital markets to support Arch’s claims under the portfolio.The deal is structured to offer investors four tranches, in Classes M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and B-1 of notes.The $341.8 million of notes will be exposed to the risk of reinsured losses across the covered mortgage-insurance policies issued by ceding insurers Arch Mortgage Insurance Co. and United Guaranty Residential Insurance Co., both of which are Arch subsidiaries.The Class M1-A tranche is targeting $127.8 million of cover, the Class M1-B tranche $106.995 million, the Class M-2 $92.134 million and the Class B-1 $14.861 million.Class B-1 is the riskiest, so would take losses first and then any covered losses would eat into the reinsurance provided by M-2, M1-B and finally M-1A tranches.It will be interesting to see how successful or large this mortgage ILS transaction from Arch is at completion, as it does offer a different type of risk profile given the modified nature of many of the insured mortgage loans.Morningstar said that, “This is the most seasoned mortgage insurance collateral that we have analyzed,” given roughly 73.2% of the loans were originated prior to 2010.As a result, the two more remote risk tranches have both been rated a notch lower than the last Bellemeade Re mortgage ILS deal.Most mortgage ILS deals have featured recently originated loans, often in the same year and unmodified as well.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

At launch this tranche was offered to investors with price guidance in a range from 4.5% to 5%, but we’re told this range has tightened towards the upper-end at 4.75% to 5%.The Class B higher risk tranche, which has an expected loss of 3.69%, is now targeting a size of $125 million to $150 million, we understand. These notes were offered to investors with price guidance in a range from 8% to 8.75%, but that range has now been fixed at 8.5%, so above the mid-point of guidance.So this could be TransRe’s largest cat bond to-date, if it reaches the maximum target size at $275 million, larger than its 2018 deal’s $250 million.Update 2:We understand that the Bowline Re 2019 cat bond has now been priced and in terms of size reached $250 million.The lower risk Class A tranche of notes stayed at $100 million in size and with coupon pricing of 4.75%, so the mid-point of initial guidance.The higher risk Class B tranche of notes grew to $150 million in size, with coupon pricing fixed at 8.5%, so above the initial mid-point of guidance.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

This is the first time the NCIUA has sought reinsurance from the catastrophe bond market on its own.Cape Lookout Re Ltd. is a newly formed Bermuda special purpose insurer and our sources say it will seek to issue a single $250 million tranche of Series 2019-1 Class A cat bond notes which will be sold to capital market investors.The proceeds from the sale of these notes will be used to collateralize the NCIUA’s underlying reinsurance needs.The reinsurance will be serviced via Hannover Re as ceding reinsurer. The German reinsurer will enter into a reinsurance agreement with the NCIUA and then enter into a retrocession agreement with Cape Lookout Re Ltd. to complete the financing of the coverage.The NCIUA will benefit from $250 million (or more) of reinsurance coverage across a three-year term, on an indemnity trigger and annual aggregate basis, against losses from named storms and severe thunderstorms to its portfolio in the state of North Carolina, under this Cape Lookout Re cat bond deal.We’re told the protection from this cat bond will attach at $1.75 billion of losses to the NCIUA and cover losses across a $500 million layer of its reinsurance program, up to $2.25 billion.This layer is set to be split between the Cape Lookout Re cat bond coverage and aggregate reinsurance, but if the cat bond market pricing is conducive it seems likely this transaction could upsize.The Series 2019-1 Class A notes that are issued by Cape Lookout Re Ltd. will have an initial attachment probability of 1.95% and an initial expected loss of 1.61%, we’re told.The notes are being offered to investors with price guidance of 3.75% to 4.25%, it is understood.Update 1:The Cape Lookout Re 2019-1 cat bond deal has upsized by 80% to provide the sponsor with $450 million of reinsurance protection at pricing.At the same time, the pricing settled at the top-end of guidance, at 4.25%.As the first U.S. hurricane exposed cat bond of 2019 the Cape Lookout Re provides an insight into appetite for risk and also pricing, with the fact it has upsized showing that appetite remains strong, but the pricing indicating that rate increases look likely.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Munich Re is co-manager","Towers Watson (Bermuda)","Atmospheric perils, snow pressure, flood","€45m","Indemnity","NR","Feb 2019","This Atmos Re DAC cat bond is being sponsored by Italian primary insurer UnipolSai Assicurazioni S.p.A.. It is the first time this sponsor has sought out reinsurance protection for weather related risks, its only previous cat bond being for Italian earthquake risks.Atmos Re DAC is a recently registered Irish domiciled special purpose vehicle, which will issue two tranches of notes to be sold to investors and the proceeds will be used to collateralise the underlying reinsurance agreements to protect UnipolSai from a range of severe weather related perils affecting Italy.Atmos Re DAC is a recently registered Irish domiciled special purpose vehicle, which will issue two tranches of notes to be sold to investors and the proceeds will be used to collateralise the underlying reinsurance agreements to protect UnipolSai from a range of severe weather related perils affecting Italy.The Atmos Re DAC notes will collateralize reinsurance agreements that will provide UnipolSai with three years of cover for perils described as atmospheric phenomenon, snow pressure and flood, we understand from sources.Atmospheric phenomena includes all kinds of severe weather related risks, such as wind storms, hail storms, thunder storms, tornadoes, snow storms, blizzards and any linked perils, so we assume that includes rainfall and related flooding. In this way the atmostpheric phenomena peril bucket collects all the typical European severe weather type risks that an insurer may want to protect itself against in Italy.Snow pressure is the risk of build ups and weight of snow or ice causing roof collapse and similar impacts to structures, we understand, while flood is both river, coastal and precipitation related.Hence the coverage within this catastrophe bond is very broad and being focused solely on Italy possibly difficult for investors to model, as the availability of risk models for all of these perils and their resulting exposure footprint is limited.The Atmos Re DAC cat bond will cover UnipolSai for losses from these perils for events across Italy on an annual aggregate and indemnity trigger basis.Two tranches of notes are to be issued, with both being set to be funded up front in terms of collateral from the investors and premium payment from the sponsor, meaning the set-up works a little more like a zero-coupon bond, with no regular spread payments, we’re told.The first Class A tranche of notes is the least risky of the two, targeting coverage for a $45 million layer of risk with an attachment probability of 1.31%, an initial expected loss of 0.45% and the coupon equivalent spread guidance is set in a range from 3.5% to 4.5%, we’re told. These notes would attach at €145 million of losses to UnipolSai’s covered business.The second tranche is a riskier Class B layer, again a €45 million coverage layer, but this time with an attachment probability of 13.74%, an initial expected loss of 5.58% and the coupon equivalent spread guidance is set in a range from 8.5% to 10.5%, we’re told. These notes would attach at €100 million of losses to UnipolSai’s covered business.It’s understood that the catastrophe risk modeller for the transaction is Towers Watson (Bermuda), which being part of the same group as the structuring agent and bookrunner Willis Towers Watson is a little unusual.But being a specialised coverage, with a range of interesting features in terms of perils and for a wide range of not frequently well modelled weather and climatic phenomena, it’s not surprising that another name isn’t featured instead.Update, Dec 21st 2018:Investor sources said this cat bond transaction may have been delayed into 2019. Some concerns have been raised over a number of features with the deal, including the unmodelled nature of some perils and we’re told it is taking longer to issue than expected.Update, Jan 29th 2019:The Atmos Re catastrophe bond is now being offered to investors as a single tranche, €45 million transaction and with higher pricing.The riskier Class B tranche of notes has been pulled from the transaction and this layer was offered in the traditional reinsurance market, we’re told.Meanwhile, the Class A tranche remained at €45 million in size and has now been offered to ILS investors with coupon price guidance in a range from 4.25% to 4.75%.Update, Feb 4th 2019:The remaining €45 million Class A tranche of Atmos Re catastrophe bond notes were successfully priced at what was the top-end of the initial guidance range, as 4.5%.Update – fourth-quarter, 2019:The Atmos Re cat bond became exposed to losses through the third-quarter as UnipolSai suffered severe losses from adverse weather and called on its reinsurance provisions.In November the Atmos Re cat bond notes were marked down for a total loss in the secondary market, implying investors faced losing all of their principal investments.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The covered area is said to be England, Scotland and Wales. The length of coverage will be three years from March 1st, split into three individual risk periods, we understand. The transaction is expected to be issued in February, market sources said.Baltic PCC Limited will issue a single tranche of Series 2019 Class A notes, we’re told, with the notes set to be sold to ILS investors and the proceeds used to collateralise a retrocessional reinsurance agreement between Baltic PCC and Pool Re itself.The coverage will be structured to trigger on an indemnity and annual aggregate basis, we understand, hence providing both occurrence protection for major terror attacks and frequency protection for a series of small terrorist attacks.We’re told that the attachment point for the coverage that Baltic PCC will provide is likely to be £500 million of loss to Pool Re, with the terrorism cat bond providing coverage across a £200 million layer, exhausting at £700 million of losses to Pool Re.That equates to an initial attachment probability of 3.05% and an initial expected loss of 2.71%, we’re told.Sources told us that there is no third-party risk modelling firm involved in this transaction, likely due to a lack of available terrorism risk models in the market.The terrorism risk cat bond notes to be issued by Baltic PCC Limited are being offered to ILS investors with coupon price guidance in a range from 5.4% to 5.9%, we understand.Update 1:The Baltic PCC terrorism risk cat bond  from Pool Re remained at UK £75 million in size, but the pricing settled at the top-end of initial guidance at 5.9%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The underlying retrocessional reinsurance contracts all have a one-year term.Each of the tranches represent a different level of seniority, hence risk level, providing investors with a wide range of risk and return options within the deal.Solidum Partners told us that the notes are largely collateralised with U.S. Treasury bills. However some of the more senior second-event notes are allowed to be collateralised using non-correlating catastrophe bonds, subject to an over collateralisation and replacement should those cat bonds suffer losses during the terms of this deal.This is a clever way to allow an investor or one of Solidum’s own funds to put perhaps lower risk and returning cat bonds to work in collateralising a higher risk and return investment opportunity, benefiting from the leverage that could provide.Should a first-event occur, those cat bonds used for collateralisation must be exchanged for cash or T-bills, Solidum said.All of the notes were settled using Solidum Partners ILSBlockchain and can now be traded amongst existing participants on the blockchain.The total volume of catastrophe bond securities on the ILSBlockchain is now $50.1 million.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Coverage will be across four annual risk periods.Hence, this is an indemnity trigger, covering medical benefit claims rate inflation risks for Aetna.For this 2019 deal, Vitality Re X Ltd. will issue a $140 million tranche of Class A notes and a $60 million tranche of Class B notes, with both covering remote layers of risk within Aetna’s book.The $140 million Class A tranche of notes will cover Aetna for medical benefit claims losses from a medical benefit ratio (MBR) attachment point of 104%, equivalent to an indemnity loss under the reinsurance of $1.04 billion we’re told, up to an MBR exhaustion at 118%, equivalent to $1.18 billion. This tranche has a modelled attachment probability equivalent to 0.04% and expected loss of less than 0.01%, we understand.The $60 million Class B tranche will cover losses from a medical benefit ratio of 98%, equivalent to an indemnity loss under the reinsurance of $980 million, to 104%, equivalent to $1.04 billion, so sit beneath the class A notes in the reinsurance tower and are a little more risky as a result. This tranche has an initial attachment probability equivalent of 0.43% and an expected loss of 0.17%.Price guidance is fixed low for both tranches, as you’d anticipate with such remote risks, and the Class A notes are set to offer investors a coupon in a range from 1.75% to 2.25%, while the Class B notes will offer a coupon from 2% to 2.75%.Encouragingly for ILS and catastrophe bond investors, the price guidance ranges are the same as for Aetna’s 2018 Vitality Re IX transaction, despite the fact this 2019 transaction is slightly lower risk.Update 1:The pricing has moved, we understand, with sources saying it has fallen to the lowest end of the coupon guidance ranges for each tranche of notes. Both tranches have now fallen to the bottom of the launch guidance ranges, with the Class A notes now offering pricing of 1.75% and the Class B notes 2%.The pricing remains roughly aligned with previous transactions.This latest Vitality Re deal is a little lower risk than last year’s issuance, but looks set to price slightly higher, so on a risk-return basis it seems there is a slight upwards shift in pricing on these health ILS deals.Update 2:The Vitality Re X transaction priced at the reduced guidance levels, with the $140m Class A notes pricing at 1.75% and the $60m Class B notes 2%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

As a result, this junior tranche acts as a profit and loss share with the MGA, and has a sharpe ratio of 2.8.The notes are variable rate principle at risk notes, but their funding is also variable with just-in-time capital contributions designed to closely match any increase in risk as the non-standard auto insurance portfolio grows.As a result this is a flexible source of capacity for the MGA, which can upsize to match its writings in this class of business, acting as both reinsurance and underwriting capital.Capital release from the notes will be at year-end, with a reinsurance-to-close to 2020 treaty to be used to offset any adverse development of reserves over and above a specified buffer level.The transaction is a novel and innovative way to bring a new class of business to an ILS investor in a manner that still supports the underlying business and the needs of the ceding originator, the AmWINS MGA in this case.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Golden State Re II Ltd. (Series 2018-1)","Golden State Re II Ltd. (Series 2018-1)","California State Compensation Insurance Fund","Willis Towers Watson Securities are sole structuring agent and bookrunner","RMS","Workers compensation claims resulting from California earthquakes","$210m","Modelled loss","?","Nov 2018","This is the California State Compensation Insurance Fund’s third catastrophe bond transaction and is very similar to the SCIF’s 2011 Golden State Re Ltd. deal and 2014 Golden State Re II Ltd. 2014-1 transaction.This cat bond marks the second issuance to use the Golden State Re II Ltd. special purpose insurer, which is incorporated in Bermuda.This Golden State Re II 2018 cat bond issue will see a single tranche of Series 2018-1 notes marketed to investors, with the capital raised from the sale of the notes set to collateralize reinsurance agreements between the SPI and the sponsor SCIF.The deal is expected to be sized at $225m or over, depending on ILS investor appetite for the transaction.This cat bond will provide the California State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF) with a 4 year source of reinsurance protection covering losses to its workers compensation portfolio of risk that are caused by earthquake events.The reinsurance protection will be afforded on a per-occurrence basis using a modelled loss trigger calculated by catastrophe risk modelling specialists RMS, in the same fashion as the previous Golden State cat bond issues.The covered area is for earthquake events that strike anywhere across the entire U.S., but as with the previous cat bonds more than 95% of the SCIF’s insurance portfolio is focused on California, as its name gives away. Hence the risk associated with this cat bond is primarily focused on California or neighbouring area earthquakes.The modelled loss trigger uses a variety of inputs and a calculation process to derive whether an event has triggered the cat bond. The trigger is of similar construct to the previous deals, using the exposures of a notional portfolio of workers compensation risks in the SCIF’s portfolio, earthquake severity factors (ground motion etc), geographic distribution of the covered portfolio, types of buildings covered, time of day and the day of week an event occurs, as some of the weighting factors that will be used to determine whether the cat bond is triggered and a payout due.After a qualifying event, which has to be an earthquake of magnitude 5.5 or greater, losses will be modelled deterministically, so not related to actual injuries and fatalities, using the earthquake event parameters and this will be modelled against the notional portfolio using day/time weighting to determine an index value and notional modelled loss or payout amount.The calculation process that runs after a qualifying earthquake event will derive an index value which will be compared against the transactions attachment point. The attachment point is at 1,000, and the exhaustion at 4,323.5 which is a larger layer of the SCIF’s reinsurance programme than the previous deals. This suggests the SCIF is using the cat bond to sit alongside its traditional protection, which is a shrewd move as the fixed cost of a cat bond can sit there across the four-year term allowing the Fund to measure effectiveness of traditional protection against it.The initial attachment probability for the notes will be 0.49% which is almost the same as the 2014 deal’s 0.5%, while the initial exhaustion probability will be 0.03% (lower than the previous deal’s 0.11% due to the much larger layer covered) and initial expected loss is 0.14% (roughly half the 0.25% EL of the 2014 Golden State Re cat bond).As a result the coupon guidance is very low for this cat bond, we understand, being marketed with a spread in a range from 1.9% to 2.2%. Again, for comparison, the coupon of the 2014 Golden State Re cat bond was 2.2%.Update 1:This catastrophe bond transaction shrank slightly during marketing to $210 million.At the same time the coupon pricing was fixed at the top-end of the marketed range, at 2.2%.Interestingly, that is the same coupon that the 2014 Golden State Re cat bond paid to its investors, but that deal had a much higher expected loss at 0.25%.This shows investors being unwilling to support a new cat bond at any cost and perhaps even demanding better returns, which is encouraging given the losses that have been faced in the last year or so.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

For this transaction the SPI will seek to issue at least $150 million of notes across two tranches of Series 2018-2 notes, with the proceeds set to be used to collateralize multi-peril reinsurance agreements for the insurer.One tranche of the notes being issued are set to provide the insurer with reinsurance protection across a single year term and the other across four years.Both tranches of notes will provide USAA with indemnity reinsurance protection on a per-occurrence basis against losses caused the by multiple U.S. perils of U.S. tropical cyclones, earthquakes (including fire following), severe thunderstorms, winter storms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, meteorite impacts, and the other perils bucket that captures other severe weather and unnamed catastrophes as well as auto & renter policy flood losses, we understand.The subject business for this catastrophe bond includes USAA’s automobile book of business, as well as homeowners, renters, and other property types, sources said.This is only the second of USAA’s cat bonds to cover its auto losses as well as property, a new feature that the insurer has added in 2018 and reflecting continued expansion of the reinsurance coverage the insurer benefits from with these cat bond deals.A currently $50 million Class 1 tranche of notes will provide USAA with one year of reinsurance coverage. This tranche is zero-coupon in nature and the riskier of the two being issued in this deal, with an initial attachment probability of 20.5% (equivalent to a $600m loss for USAA), an expected loss of 14.07% and is being offered to investors with a coupon equivalent (remember it is zero-coupon) spread in a range from 18.25% to 20.25%.The second tranche of notes, a currently $100 million Class 2 tranche, will provide a four-year term of reinsurance cover to USAA. These notes have an initial attachment probability of 9.53% (equivalent to a $1 billion loss for USAA), an expected loss of 6.45% and are being offered to investors with coupon price guidance in a range from 11% to 12%.Both tranches of notes cover a wide layer of risk, giving plenty of room for USAA to upsize this latest ResRe catastrophe bond deal should the insurer choose to maximise its reinsurance coverage from the capital markets. With this transaction having a long marketing period of almost one month we expect USAA is looking to use the cat bond as a way to test pricing and appetite for these layers of risk, so any upsizing will depend on demand from traditional reinsurance markets for the risk as well.Update 1:USAA’s latest catastrophe bond increased in size to $200 million while marketing.The $50 million Class 1 tranche of zero-coupon notes did not upsize and have been priced at the top-end of their range, a coupon equivalent of 20.25%.The Class 2 tranche of notes grew by one-third to $150 million and the pricing on the Class 2 tranche was fixed at the mid-point of guidance, at 11.5%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The beneficiary of the coverage is Sempra Energy, an electricity utility provider, and certain subsidiaries of the company. It’s a very similar transaction to the recent Cal Phoenix Re cat bond, for PG&E Corporation.With the transaction, Sempra Energy is seeking a $125 million or greater source of California wildfire insurance from the capital markets, with Hannover Re acting as the ceding reinsurance firm for the transaction.Like the Cal Phoenix Re cat bond, the SD Re Ltd. transaction will cover the beneficiary against losses it suffers due to wildfires that have been caused by its own infrastructure. As a result the coverage should be considered wildfire property liability protection for Sempra.In the SD Re Ltd. transaction, the wildfire property liability risk is being ceded using Energy Insurance Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Energy Insurance Mutual (of which Sempra Energy is a member) as the reinsured party and reinsurance firm Hannover Re as the ceding reinsurer. Energy Insurance Services then provides the capital markets backed insurance protection to Sempra.As a result, this new SD Re Ltd. (Series 2018-1) catastrophe bond is an indemnity trigger arrangement, with the sale of the $125 million or more notes issued by SD Re Ltd. set to collateralize the retrocessional reinsurance agreement between SD Re Ltd. and Hannover Re, which in turn provides the reinsurance protection to Energy Insurance Mutual, which then insures the Sempra Energy wildfire property liability risk.So, Sempra Energy’s corporate risk exposure to wildfires that its own infrastructure, facilities, operations or equipment could cause, travels through multiple layers of insurance, reinsurance and retrocession to the capital markets, allowing for an indemnity coverage arrangement to be put in place for Sempra, backed by the efficiency of ILS market capacity.Energy Insurance Services, Inc., the insured and subsidiary of Energy Insurance Mutual, is a provider of third-party liability insurance coverage to energy utility and related companies.Bermuda special purpose insurance vehicle SD Re Ltd. will aim to sell at least $125 million tranche of Series 2018-1 notes to investors, with the proceeds providing the capital to back the risk transfer for Sempra Energy.The SD Re Ltd. wildfire cat bond will afford Sempra Energy a three-year source of insurance protection against property damages caused by wildfires in the state of California,on a third-party wildfire liability basis, so the damage caused by wildfires for which Sempra is liable.As with the previous Cal Phoenix Re cat bond for PG&E, this cat bond also features litigation risks related to the third-party wildfire related property damages, which are categorised under loss adjustment expenses.SD Re, as issuer, will issue the notes to be sold to ILS funds and ILS investors, with the proceeds providing the collateral to back a three-year annual aggregate and indemnity reinsurance arrangement with Hannover Re, the ceding reinsurer, and the coverage cascading back via Energy Insurance Services as the reinsured, to Sempra Energy as the insured party.The cover is for California wildfires that are caused by or due to infrastructure, facilities and operations owned by or of the insured Sempra Energy.We’re told that the currently $125 million tranche of Series 2018-1 notes to be issued by SD Re will have an initial attachment point of $1.325 billion and cover losses up to $1.465 billion, with a $50m franchise deductible per event. While that’s a $140 million layer, it seems Sempra will retain the difference between the $125 million of notes and the layer size.According to our sources, that equates to a modelled initial attachment probability of 0.21%, an initial expected loss of 0.21% and we the notes to be issued by SD Re are being offered to investors with coupon pricing guidance of 3.5% to 4.5%.As with the Cal Phoenix cat bond this is a significant multiple, likely to ensure investors feel well-compensated for taking on potential unknowns and third-party liability with this catastrophe bond, including the litigation risk that will be included under loss adjustment expenses.Update 1:The SD Re Ltd. catastrophe bond did not upsize, remaining at $125 million as was expected due to Sempra Energy’s retention of the additional risk in the covered layer.The coupon settled at the mid-point of initial guidance, at 4%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Meanwhile the size remained unchanged at a target of up to $250 million.Update 2:This Ursa Re 2018-1 cat bond eventually completed at the maximum target size of $250 million, while pricing was fixed at just below the initial mid-point at 5.1%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The SPI is set to issue four tranches of ten-year notes which will be sold to investors to collateralize underlying mortgage reinsurance agreements that will protect the Arch Mortgage Insurance book on an indemnity basis over the 10 year term.Another two tranches, or coverage layers, are to be largely retained by Arch Capital, including the first loss layer for the covered portfolio of mortgage insurance risks.In this Bellemeade Re 2018-2 mortgage ILS deal from Arch, the reinsurance protection will cover a diverse portfolio of mortgage insurance policies related to 357,594 loans, underwritten by Arch. The mortgages are considered seasoned and the total balance of the insured mortgage loans covered by the policies amounts to $74.70 billion, while the aggregate of the mortgage insurance policy coverage is $12.81 billion.This transaction features mortgage loans that are on average seasoned by 42 months, being originated between April 1, 2013 and Dec. 31, 2015, making this mortgage ILS the first to feature older loans, as most other mortgage insurance-linked note transactions have featured more recently underwritten loans and insurance policies. Additionally, only 1.7% of the loans have experienced a delinquency in the prior 24 months.This is a sign that Arch Capital is expanding the capital markets participation in its mortgage reinsurance program, which if successful will likely mean more such deals from other sponsors in future as well.The four tranches of ten-year term Bellemeade Re 2018-2 insurance-linked securities (ILS) will provide Arch with $653.28 million of fully-collateralized reinsurance coverage against potential losses on this portion of its mortgage insurance portfolio.

However, we cannot confirm this.Dodeka XVII’s $18.322 million of notes were admitted to the Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX) as Section V Insurance Related Securities after the notes were sold to qualified ILS investors, which will be funds or managed accounts operated by Twelve Capital.As with all of the Dodeka series of private ILS deals, we assume that this Dodeka XVII cat bond lite features a transformed industry-loss warranty (ILW) contract, using a PCS industry loss trigger and covering U.S. natural catastrophe risks (which is most likely U.S. wind because of the risk period).Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The sponsor is also a first to the market, being PG&E Corporation an electrical utility provider.With the transaction, PG&E Corporation (the Pacific Gas and Electric Company) is seeking a $200 million or greater source of California wildfire insurance from the capital markets, helped by ceding reinsurance firm Tokio Millennium Re.Being a corporate beneficiary of a property catastrophe bond exposed solely to California wildfire risks you might have thought that the PG&E cat bond would feature a parametric trigger, but it doesn’t as the risk is being ceded via Energy Insurance Mutual (of which PG&E is a member) as the insured and reinsurance firm Tokio Millennium Re AG.Because of that layering of risk transfer the new Cal Phoenix Re Ltd. (Series 2018-1) catastrophe bond is an indemnity arrangement, with the sale of the notes issued by Cal Phoenix Re Ltd. set to collateralize the retrocessional reinsurance agreement with Tokio Millennium Re, which in turn provides the reinsurance protection to Energy Insurance Mutual, which then insures the PG&E Corporation risk.It’s an interesting way to see the corporate risk of PG&E cascade through multiple layers of insurance, reinsurance and retrocession to the capital markets, allowing for an indemnity coverage arrangement to be put in place, backed by the efficiency of ILS capacity.Bermuda special purpose insurer Cal Phoenix Re Ltd. will aim to sell a $200 million tranche of Series 2018-1 notes to investors, with the proceeds providing the capital to back the risk transfer for PG&E.The cat bond will ultimately provide PG&E with a three-year source of insurance protection against property damages caused by wildfires in the state of California, but interestingly this appears to be third-party wildfire liability so the damage caused by wildfires for which PG&E is liable.This seems to be a first in the catastrophe bond market, providing PG&E with a way to transfer a significant risk to its business to the capital markets.It also appears that under loss adjustment expenses will be included certain litigation risks related to the third-party wildfire related property damages, which again appears to be a first in the cat bond marketplace.The insured Energy Insurance Mutual Limited, actually its subsidiary Energy Insurance Services, Inc., is a provider of third-party liability insurance coverage to energy utility and related companies.It appears that this new Cal Phoenix Re cat bond is a direct response to the recent severe California wildfire season, which had seen PG&E threatened with liability cases, according to news reports.Cal Phoenix Re, as issuer, will issue the notes to be sold to ILS funds and ILS investors, with the proceeds backing a three-year annual aggregate and indemnity reinsurance arrangement with Tokio Millennium Re, the reinsured, although the coverage cascades back to PG&E.The cover is for California wildfires that are caused by or due to infrastructure owned by the insured PG&E.We’re told that the currently $200 million tranche of Series 2018-1 notes to be issued by Cal Phoenix Re will have an initial attachment point of $1.25 billion and cover a $500 million layer from there upwards, with a franchise deductible per event.That equates to a modelled initial attachment probability of 1.35%, an initial expected loss of 1.01% and we understand that the notes are being offered to investors with coupon guidance of 6% to 6.5%.That’s a significant multiple, which could be to ensure investors feel compensated for taking on potential unknowns with this catastrophe bond, such as the litigation risk that could be included under loss adjustment expenses.Update 1:The Cal Phoenix Re catastrophe bond looks set to increase in size to as much as $225 million, while the pricing has been lifted to 20% higher than the original mid-point at 7.5%.Update 2:The Cal Phoenix Re catastrophe bond did not upsize in the end, instead settling to provide PG&E with $200 million of protection through what is now the first corporate cat bond featuring an indemnity trigger, the first cat bond to provide protection solely against wildfire risks, and also the first cat bond to cover third-party liabilities of a corporate (rather than a re/insurer).Update, May 16th 2019:Investigators from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) have deemed the cause of the devastating Camp wildfire of 2018 to be electrical transmission lines owned and operated by Pacific Gas and Electricity (PG&E).As a result the expectation is that the Cal Phoenix Re cat bond will be a total loss, paying out in full to PG&E as part of a reinsurance recovery made under the terms of its third-party property liability tower.The notes have been considered at severe risk for some months now, with the notes having been marked down at first by brokers back in November 2018 right after the Camp wildfire occurred.Hence cat bond investment funds had already largely accounted for a full loss from this cat bond.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

This Class A tranche has an initial attachment probability of 6.04%, expected loss of 4.94% and is being offered to investors with price guidance in a range from 11.25% to 12%, we understand.The second is marketed as a $75 million Class B tranche, which would attach at losses above $5 billion and cover a percentage up to $10 billion, giving the notes an initial attachment probability of 9.68%, expected loss of 6.32% and this tranche is offered to investors with price guidance for a coupon in a range from 13.5% to 14.25%.Another first for this FloodSmart Re cat bond is the risk modelling agent, as this service is to be provided by flood risk modelling specialists KatRisk LLC. This is the first time KatRisk has been involved in a catastrophe bond transaction, as far as we are aware.So this FloodSmart Re cat bond has been designed to provide reinsurance protection to the NFIP and FEMA after major named storm related flooding events, such as those seen with hurricane Katrina, last year’s hurricane Harvey and superstorm Sandy.As we understand, a repeat of Katrina would result in a total loss for the FloodSmart Re cat bond investors, where as a repeat of Harvey or Sandy would erode the principal of both tranches but not cause a total payout.As flooding from named storms can take time to develop, sometimes after a hurricane or tropical storm has technically dissipated, the terms of the cat bond mean that flood insurance losses will be covered for up to 504 hours after the event date, we’re told.Another point to note is that the named storm related flooding can be from either storm surge or rainfall.FloodSmart Re Ltd. will provide FEMA with broad reinsurance protection for the NFIP against named storm risks then, as it is surge and rainfall that cause its policies to pay out, given it does not cover property damage from anything other than water.Update 1:FEMA’s FloodSmart Re 2018-1 cat bond is understood to have expanded by 82% to $500 million, while pricing has dropped to the bottom of guidance during marketing.We’re now told that the Class A tranche, with its expected loss of 4.94% has grown by 63% to $325 million in size, while its pricing is set to settle at the bottom end of the marketed 11.25% to 12% range, so is expected to pay investors a coupon of 11.25%.The Class B tranche, which is the riskier with its expected loss of 6.32%, has grown by 133% to $175 million in size and its pricing has now been fixed again at the lowest end of the marketed range of 13.5% to 14.25%, so with investors set to receive a coupon of 13.5%.Update 2:The FloodSmart Re 2018-1 catastrophe bond issuance was successfully completed at the upsized $500 million and with pricing at the lowest end of guidance.“Reinsurance is a lynchpin to help strengthen the financial framework of the NFIP,” explained David Maurstad, chief executive of the National Flood Insurance Program. “Engaging capital markets was the logical next step in maturing the NFIP Reinsurance Program in a way that benefits policyholders and taxpayers, and expands the role of the private markets in managing flood risk in the United States.”The cat bond, which is structured into two tranches, provides FEMA with reinsurance coverage for 3.5% of its losses between an attachment point of $5 billion and exhaustion of $10 billion through the riskier $175 million tranche of Class B notes, and 13% of its losses between $7.5 billion and $10 billion through a $325 million tranche of Class A notes.FEMA said that it will pay $62 million in premium for the first year of coverage, with the cat bond term running for three years from August 1st 2018 to July 31st 2021.Added to FEMA’s January 2018 procurement of $1.46 billion of traditional reinsurance coverage from 28 reinsurance companies, the Agency has now transferred $1.96 billion of the NFIP’s flood risk to private markets.More than 35 capital market investor groups, ILS or cat bond funds, mutual funds and direct investors, invested in the FloodSmart Re cat bond transaction.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The Class M-2 is more risky, having been rated BB-. The Class B-1 is the most junior and risky layer of notes, with a preliminary rating of B+.The notes are exposed to the performance of a pool of mortgage-insurance policies that are linked to residential loans. The residential mortgage loans are insured against certain losses through the underlying mortgage insurance policy pool, which are in turn covered by the reinsurance agreement with Oaktown Re II Ltd. that is to be collateralized by the sale of the mortgage insurance ILS notes.The pool of insured loans are not in default, is geographically diverse with California the largest contributor to the risk at 14.1%, and is counted at 121,621 loans according to Morningstar.The balance of the insured mortgage loans covered by the policies amounts to $30.21 billion, while the aggregate mortgage-insurance coverage totals $5.57 billion.The notes are only exposed to the risk of reinsured losses on the pool of mortgage-insurance policies issued by National Mortgage Insurance Corporation.Update 1:The three tranches of notes have now been priced with no changes to the size of the offering either.A $133,665,000 tranche of Class M-1 Notes will pay investors a coupon of 1.55%, a $116,957,000 tranche of Class M-2 Notes will pay a coupon of 2.85%, and a $13,923,000 tranche of Class B-1 Notes will pay a coupon of 4.05%, all above one-month LIBOR rates.The transaction is expected to complete on July 25th 2018.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

However at the mid-point of 3% that would still provide a very reasonable multiple of 3.7 times the expected loss.Update 1:Sources said that the single tranche of notes had grown by a third to make this into a $400 million offering.At the same time, we’re told that the coupon guidance range of 2.75% to 3.25% was dropped to the bottom of that range, to offer investors a 2.75% return for their investment in the notes. Even at this lowered level the notes will pay investors a multiple of almost 3.4 times the expected loss.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

We’re told that initially the notes would attach at $315 million of losses after Frontline’s retention.The transaction will see Frontline Re Ltd. issuing two tranches of notes, a $250 million Class A tranche which is the less risky layer and a $100 million Class B tranche which sits beneath the A notes.The Frontline Re 2018-1 Class A notes will have an initial attachment probability of 6.12%, an initial expected loss of 4.04% and are offered to cat bond investors with coupon guidance in a range from 6.75% to 7.25%.While the Frontline Re 2018-1 Class B notes, the riskier layer, will have an initial attachment probability of 10.76%, an initial expected loss of 8.13% and are offered to cat bond investors with coupon guidance in a range from 11.5% to 12.25%.Update 1:The Frontline Re 2018-1 Class A notes, which have an initial expected loss of 4.04%, were launched with coupon guidance in a range from 6.75% to 7.25%. But this has now been fixed at the middle of that range, at 7% we’re told.The Frontline Re 2018-1 Class B notes, with an initial expected loss of 8.13%, were offered to cat bond investors with coupon guidance in a range from 11.5% to 12.25%. This tranche now has its pricing fixed just below the mid-point, at 11.75% we understand.Update Q1 2019:The Frontline Re cat bond’s riskier $100 million Class B tranche is considered at risk of potential losses due to the sponsors rising ultimate loss from 2018’s hurricane Michael. Currently the notes are marked down and discounted roughly 50% on secondary cat bond pricing sheets.Update January 2020:The Frontline Re cat bonds Class B notes have been marked right down to bids around 20 on broker pricing sheets, with secondary trades seen at both 20 and 10 cents on the dollar, implying investors are expecting this tranche will face a total loss once the sponsors full ultimate loss from hurricane Michael is understood.Update June 2021:The $250 million Class A tranche of notes remain marked down at anything from 55 to 75 cents on the dollar in broker pricing sheets, implying up to a 45% loss of principal for this layer is still anticipated as hurricane Michael still develops for the sponsor.Meanwhile, the once $100 million Class B tranche of notes have had their principal reduced to $23.63 million, suggesting reinsurance recoveries made and remain marked down at around 5 cents on the dollar, suggesting the majority of this layer is expected to pay out.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 1761A) which matured recently.As ever, details are scarce, due to the privately arranged and placed nature of the Resilience Re cat bond offerings, but we can assume the deal covers property catastrophe risks given their prevalence in the insurance-linked securities (ILS) marketplace.In this latest deal, Resilience Re Ltd. has issued a single $37 million tranche of Series 1861A discounted zero coupon notes, which have been placed with qualified investors and admitted for listing on the Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX) as Section V – Insurance Related Securities.The notes are due June 7th 2019, suggesting they cover a one-year reinsurance arrangement from the mid-year renewal.Willis Towers Watson Securities will have acted as the lead structuring agent and bookrunner for this private cat bond, structuring and facilitating the deal between sponsor and investors, through the transformation of a reinsurance arrangement into a securitised cat bond note with secondary liquidity features.Update – June 2019:The maturity date for this $37 million private cat bond issuance has been extended by a year to June 6th 2020, presumably to allow for potential loss development after some of the catastrophe events of 2018.Update – Apr 2020:These notes have now had their maturity date extended by another year, with the maturity for the $37 million Resilience Re 1861A tranche of notes now extended right out to June 7th 2021.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Operational Re II Ltd.","Operational Re II Ltd.","Zurich Insurance Co. Ltd.","?","Milliman Inc","Operational risks","$148m","Indemnity","?","Jun 2018","This is the second securitisation of operational risk insurance using a capital markets special purpose vehicle domiciled in Bermuda and a structure like a catastrophe bond.We understand that this Operational Re II Ltd. transaction again features insurer Zurich as the ceding company, that has entered into reinsurance agreements with Bermuda SPI Operational Re II Ltd. to acquire the capital markets backed, fully-collateralized coverage to back an operational risk insurance policy.We’re told that Zurich Insurance Co. Ltd. is again the ceding company, or sponsor, for the Operational Re II Ltd. transaction, which sees the insurer tapping ILS and capital market investors for a source of fully-collateralized reinsurance to back an operational risk insurance agreement between itself and a bank or asset manager, which we understand is almost certainly Credit Suisse again.For this second arrangement we believe the investment bank that benefits from the coverage to be Credit Suisse again, returning to the ILS market to top up its coverage, as the initial Operational Re transaction had been much smaller than hoped for (it had originally targeted a CHF 630 million issuance) back in 2016.This new Operational Re II Ltd. transaction has been offered on a semi-private basis, we understand, compared to the more broadly marketed 2016 deal.So, this new transaction will provide a CHF 146 million (approx $148 million) fully-collateralised source of insurance and reinsurance protection to back an operational risk insurance policy provided by insurer Zurich to one of its corporate clients, which we understand to be Credit Suisse.This arrangement will provide the ultimate beneficiary with just less than three years of protection, with maturity of the three tranches of notes slated for April 8th 2021.That is the exact same maturity date as the three tranches of notes from the original Operational Re transaction. So this points to Operational Re II Ltd. being an extension of the coverage for Credit Suisse, as the investment bank looks to expand the capital markets backed operational risk protection it benefits from.One source has told us that the three tranches of notes fill some of the gaps in the covered layer that had originally been sought for Credit Suisse in the first Operational Re deal, thus providing it with more coverage across the original layer, which had attached at CHF 3.5 billion of losses under the operational risk insurance agreement in any annual risk period (the attachment point), with an exhaustion point set at CHF 4.2 billion.The original underlying insurance policy, which it seems these notes also support, and the reinsurance from the Operational Re II ILS notes will provide annual aggregate coverage against certain operational risk losses. There are specific limits in place to ensure that no single operational risk loss event, or defined category of loss, can trigger the notes on its own, making these deals effectively a second and subsequent loss event ILS cover.As with the first operational risk cat bond, we assume this new transaction will provide cover for a range of risks, including certain cyber risk exposures, such as IT system failure that causes business interruption; fraudulent behaviour both of external parties and employees of the investment bank; fiduciary issues; losses due to improper business practices or unauthorised activity; accounting errors; documentation errors; regulatory compliance issues; HR issues; discrimination in the workplace; or even personal injury.The coverage is just one aspect, as these deals also help the investment bank to reduce its risk weighted assets (RWA’s). In fact the first CHF 220m deal helped Credit Suisse reduce its RWA’s by 1.25 billion Swiss Francs.As such these transactions offer broad operational risk insurance coverage, but through the mechanism of an ILS or cat bond and with reinsurance support from capital markets investors.The CHF 146 million of notes are split across two Rule 144A tranches of notes and one RegS tranche, which is likely to meet a specific investors needs.The Operational Re II Ltd. transaction features the issuance of a CHF 24.5 million Class A tranche of Rule 144A notes, a CHF 53 million Class A tranche of RegS notes and a CHF 68.5 million Class B tranche of Rule 144A notes.So, with this transaction, Credit Suisse (we understand) has topped up the amount of operational risk insurance cover it has that is backed by the capital markets to the tune of CHF 366 million (approx $377m) across the two Operational Re ILS arrangements, with all of that coverage from the two deals now running until April 8th 2021.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The second, a $10.5 million Series 2018-01A Notes – SAC EC0011 tranche. Finally, the largest is a $38 million Series 2018-01A Notes – SAC EC0012 tranche.All three tranches of notes issued by Eclipse Re Ltd. have been admitted for listing on the Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX) as Insurance Related Securities.The maturity date is set as the 1st July 2019, so the transaction likely features the collateralization of reinsurance arrangements covering just around a one year term, so likely transacted for a mid-year renewal.The $53.3 million of Eclipse Re 2018-01A notes were privately placed with qualified investors, with we assume Rewire Securities acting as the bookrunner for the transaction.Horseshoe Group acted as the listing sponsor, through its Horseshoe Corporate Services entity.Sources told Artemis that the sponsor behind this transaction is a U.S. based primary insurer, that the perils ceded are U.S. property catastrophe risks and that the deal features an indemnity trigger.We also understand that the sponsor is likely the same as the sponsor of the $53.3 million Eclipse Re Ltd. (Series 2017-02A) transaction, which had exactly the same tranche sizes and was issued a year earlier. It’s likely this new Eclipse Re deal is a renewal of that 2017 transaction.Update 1:Sources told us that U.S. Coastal Insurance Company is the sponsor of this Eclipse Re private catastrophe bond.The 2018 reinsurance program has been designed to cover U.S. Coastal up to $250 million of losses and we understand that the three tranches of notes issued under the Eclipse Re 2018-01A transaction sit on top of each other and have cascading features, so that they drop down to replace eroded coverage for second and subsequent catastrophe events.Here’s how we understand the three Series 2018-01A tranches of notes to be position.Beneath the collateralized coverage provided by the Eclipse Re private cat bond U.S. Coastal has a $2 million retention and then a $7 million inuring layer of traditional reinsurance, both of which have to be eroded before the collateralized layers begin to cascade down.The first $4.8 million of SAC EC0010 tranche attaches at $9 million of losses, covering 30% of a $16 million layer, and pays investors a net rate on-line equivalent of 7.5%, we understand.The second $10.5 million SAC EC0011 tranche sits above that, attaching at $25 million and covering 30% of losses up to $60 million, while paying investors a rate on-line equivalent of 5%, our sources said.The final and largest $38 million SAC EC0012 tranche is at the top, attaching at $60 million of losses and again covering 30% of the $190 million layer up to the top of the program at $250 million. This tranche pays investors a rate on-line equivalent of 3.25%, we are told.We’re also told that U.S. Coastal was the sponsor of 2017’s also $53.3 million Eclipse Re Ltd.

However, this tranche, the least risky with an initial expected loss of 0.63% were initially offered with coupon price guidance of 3.25% to 3.75%, but this has looks set to price at the middle or above, as the guidance is now 3.5% to 3.75%, we understand.It’s possible that the pricing on this tranche is a reaction to the fact investors are expecting to pay for some of Nationwide’s losses this year, meaning their minimum return requirements are perhaps higher than they would have been otherwise.The Class B tranche of notes also began at $75 million in size and that hasn’t changed, but the notes with their initial expected loss of 1.48% and initial coupon price guidance of 4.75% to 5.25%, are set to price down, with guidance now lowered to 4.5% to 4.75%, we hear.The initially $100 million Class C tranche of notes have grown the most, now offering $175 million of notes to investors. With their initial expected loss of 2.94%, we understand that the launch price guidance of 7.75% to 8.5% is falling to 7.5% to 7.75%, reflecting strong demand for this layer of Nationwide’s reinsurance tower.The last Class D tranche that was targeting $50 million has also grown to $75 million, with an initial expected loss of 4.8% this is the riskiest tranche, but we understand investor appetite has helped to lower the launch with coupon price guidance of 10.75% to 11.5% down to a new range at 10.5% to 10.75%.At $450 million in size, this Caelus Re V 2018-1 catastrophe bond from Nationwide Mutual is set to be the insurers largest.Update 2:Nationwide Mutual’s Caelus Re V 2018-1 catastrophe bond completed at $450 million in size, with pricing on three tranches falling to below the initial guidance, while the fourth settled at the mid-point. However, all four tranches have priced slightly higher than their equivalents from Nationwide’s 2017 cat bond, as investors sought higher rates in return for having taken losses due to the major hurricanes and wildfires in the prior year.The $125 million Caelus Re V Series 2018-1 Class A tranche of notes priced at the mid-point of 3.5%, we’re told.The $75 million Class B tranche of notes priced at the lowest end of reduced guidance of 4.5%.The $175 million Class C tranche of notes priced at the lowest end of 7.5%.The final $75 million Class D tranche saw pricing has been fixed again at the low-end of already reduced guidance at 10.5%.Update Dec 12th, 2018:Two tranches of Nationwide Mutual’s Caelus Re V Ltd. (Series 2018-1) catastrophe bond have been marked down in the secondary market due to market expectations they could face losses from the recent California wildfires.With the recent Camp and Woolsey wildfires now expected to drive in excess of $15 billion of losses to the insurance and reinsurance industry and Nationwide Mutual exposed through its property book in California, the ILS market is now forecasting potential losses from two tranches of the Caelus Re V 2018-1 bond.The Caelus Re V 2018-1 Class C tranche of notes is the less risky of the two marked down. This $175 million tranche of notes has been marked down for as much as a roughly 40% loss of principal at this time, equivalent to a $40 million loss to investors.The most risky tranche from this cat bond is the Caelus Re V Class D, a $75 million tranche of notes which has now been marked down for around a 70% loss, equivalent to a roughly $52.5 million loss of principal.The Class C notes would attach at $1.5 billion of losses to Nationwide, while the Class D notes attach a little sooner at $1.4 billion.It’s worth noting that Nationwide said its 2017 wildfire losses amounted to $1.4 billion gross, or $1.1 billion net. So it’s easy to imagine some impact to these cat bonds from the 2018 wildfire events.Update July 2019:Some tranches of Nationwide’s $450 million Caelus Re V 2018-1 catastrophe bond issuance remain at risk of losses, due to the impacts of the 2018 year catastrophe events.Aggregate losses threatening the Caelus 2018 cat bond are due to the California wildfires, hurricane Michael, hurricane Florence and a number of severe thunderstorm events, we understand.Currently estimated aggregate ultimate net losses for the June 2018 and onwards annual risk period amount to just over $1.08 billion, while the attachment point for the notes sits at $1.4 billion currently, we’re told.At this stage the riskiest $75 million Class D tranche are marked down in the secondary market on an expectation of a roughly 50% loss of principal, while the $175 million Class C tranche are marked for a 20% or so loss. It’s going to take some serious ongoing development for the triggers to be breached it appears, but after the experience with 2017 it seems investors are being cautious with these 2018 cat bond tranches.It could be some time before any final loss amounts and reinsurance recoveries are fully understood for these 2018-1 Caelus Re V cat bond tranches.Update April 2021:Nationwide elected to extend the maturity dates on all tranches of this catastrophe bond through until June 2025.The Class A, B, C and D Series 2018-1 notes issued by Caelus Re V Ltd., which amount to $450 million in cat bonds, have all had their maturities extended through to June 7th 2025.All four of these tranches of notes remain marked down in the secondary market, with the most recent movements in their price being related to the US winter storm and Texas freeze loss event in February 2021 and this latest increase in Nationwide’s ultimate over the latest risk period.Given these 2018-1 cat bond notes from Caelus Re V have not faced an extension event previously, it seems reasonable to assume that this extension of maturity through till June 2025 is a result of the current risk period and the addition of these winter storm losses, rather than any continuation of loss development from prior years.The latest annual aggregate risk period for the Caelus Re V 2018-1 cat bonds began in June 2020 and runs until the end of May 2021, so this extension is related to the aggregation of losses over this term, of which the winter storms are potentially the largest contributor, given Nationwide is said to have been quite exposed to those storms and the Texas freezing weather.We don’t know the exact attachment points for the 2018-1 tranches for the current risk period, as they’ve likely been adjusted at each annual reset, but at their launch the $75 million Class D tranche of notes attached at $1.4 billion of losses, which was the lowest.The $75 million of Caelus Re V 2018-1 Class D notes attached at $1.4 billion and provides annual aggregate reinsurance protection to $1.5 billion of losses, suggesting these notes are at definite risk of losses, even if the attachment has been adjusted somewhat at a reset (as it’s unlikely to be all that much higher).This Class D tranche is currently marked down at levels suggesting a total loss of the $75 million of principal in broker secondary pricing sheets.The $175 million of Caelus Re V 2018-1 Class C notes attached at $1.5 billion and provides annual aggregate reinsurance protection to $1.75 billion of losses, suggesting these notes are also under threat of attachment now.This Class C tranche is currently marked down at levels suggesting a potential 60% to 80% loss of the $175 million of principal from this layer.The $75 million of Caelus Re V 2018-1 Class B notes attached at $1.75 billion and provides annual aggregate reinsurance protection to $2 billion of losses, suggesting these notes face a greater threat, but are still not close to attaching at this time.This Class B tranche is currently marked down at levels suggesting a potential 30% to 50% loss of the $75 million of principal from this layer.Finally, the $125 million of Caelus Re V 2018-1 Class A notes attached at $2 billion and provides annual aggregate reinsurance protection to $2.5 billion of losses, suggesting these notes are less likely to attach without additional fresh losses in the current risk period, or quite significant loss creep to occur on prior events.This Class A tranche is currently marked down at levels suggesting a potential 10% to 20% loss of the $125 million of principal from this layer, reflecting ongoing erosion of the aggregate deductible as Nationwide’s ultimate rises.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Both tranches will feature an indemnity trigger, with coverage on a per-occurrence and cascading basis.The currently $75 million tranche of Integrity Re Series 2018-1 Class A notes will be exposed to Florida named storm protection only. These notes will sit at the top of American Integrity’s reinsurance tower and given the cascading nature will drop-down as events erode stated reinsurance, FHCF and other cat bond layers beneath.The Integrity Re Series 2018-1 Class A notes have an initial attachment probability of 1.34%, an initial expected loss of 1.27% and are to be offered to cat bond investors with guide pricing in a range from 3.75% to 4.25%.The currently $10 million Integrity Re Series 2018-1 Class B tranche of notes will be exposed to both Florida named storms and Florida severe thunderstorm risks. This tranche is much riskier, sitting alongside the FHCF coverage within American Interity’s reinsurance tower.The Integrity Re Series 2018-1 Class B notes have an initial attachment probability of 9.86% and an initial expected loss of 5.74%. Our sources told us that the guide pricing for this tranche of notes is only available through enquiry to the bookrunners, so not available to us at this time. Clearly the price will be higher but it’s possible that American Integrity does not want to advertise it to potential reinsurance counterparties until its program for the 2018 renewal is arranged.Update 1:The Integrity Re Series 2018-1 Class A notes remain at $75 million in size and price guidance dropped to the bottom end at 3.75%.The Integrity Re Series 2018-1 Class B tranche of notes shrank to just $4 million in size, while the price guidance we now understand to be 9.5% for this riskier layer of notes.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

We’re told the new coupon price guidance for the notes is in a range from 3.5% to 4%.Update 2:It’s clear that investor demand has helped UPC to reduce the cost of the premium paid for its latest cat bond, with the notes now priced at the bottom end of the already reduced range, at 3.5%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The coverage will be for the states of Florida, Louisiana and Texas initially, with the ability to expand at annual resets if the sponsor chooses, we’re told.Manatee Re II Ltd. will seek to issue two tranches of notes, currently targeting a $165 million issuance, which will be sold to qualified investors to collateralize the necessary reinsurance agreements with the insurer.The coverage from this cat bond is on an indemnity trigger basis and designed as a cascading and per-occurrence structure the coverage will drop down as underlying stated reinsurance layers are eroded by loss events.A currently $125 million Class A tranche of notes is the less risky of the two, with an initial attachment probability of 2.22% and an expected loss of 1.08%. This layer sits higher up in Safepoint’s reinsurance tower, above its FHCF and much of its other reinsurance coverage.

This approach also enables State Farm to build deeper relationships with key ILS investor and ILS fund markets, especially those that also participate in its traditional reinsurance renewal.Additionally, the catastrophe bond issuance will provide State Farm with vital pricing indications that can assist in its overall reinsurance program negotiations.We’re told that the covered perils ceded to ILS investors through this Merna Re 2018 cat bond are U.S. earthquake risks, most likely from the New Madrid fault region in the mid-west where State Farm has a significant exposure. This would be the same covered peril as the insurers last few cat bond transactions.This Merna Re 2018-1 cat bond will utilise an indemnity trigger, as State Farm’s cat bond coverage tends to provide the insurer with a source of indemnity reinsurance protection.This Merna Re 2018-1 cat bond has a three-year term, with the notes coming due for maturity at the 8th April 2021.The fully collateralized reinsurance protection that State Farm benefits from with this new Merna cat bond deal will likely replace the recently matured $300 million Merna Re 2015-1 New Madrid quake transaction.Other facts on this transaction such as expected loss, attachment point and pricing are not known at this stage, due to the privately syndicated nature of the deal.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The coverage will not include Florida and New Jersey, sources said.The notes will feature an indemnity trigger, but the coverage they provide will be both on a per-occurrence and an annual aggregate basis, a novel structure affording the insurer two sections of reinsurance protection within a single tranche of notes. We understand both layers will provide $500 million of coverage, so there is a chance this cat bond upsizes while marketing.As a result of this novel feature, we understand the multiple paid by this cat bond will be relatively high to compensate investors for the dual occurrence and aggregate sections of risk.The Sanders Re 2018-1 cat bond notes will have an initial expected loss of 0.64% and are being offered to investors with spread guidance of 5.5% to 6.25%, we’re told.Also noteworthy are the naming of perils, with severe weather possibly designed to include more than just severe thunderstorm risks, fire more than just wildfire, and other perils a catch-all likely able to capture losses from any perils Allstate and subsidiaries are affected by over the term of the catastrophe bond deal.These expansions of coverage likely make the Sanders Re 2018-1 cat bond more commensurate with the reinsurance protection Allstate secures from its traditional program.Update 1:Allstates Sanders Re 2018-1 catastrophe bond issuance looks set to upsize before pricing, with the latest indications showing the deal at $500 million.Investors response to the novel structure appears to have been robust, as the transaction is now set to issue a $500 million tranche of notes, upping the reinsurance coverage Allstate will receive from it by 25%.Investors are set to be compensated for the dual coverage approach of this catastrophe bond it seems, with the expected loss set at an initial 0.64% the multiple paid by the notes is much higher than typical U.S. multi-peril deals.The price guidance was set in a range from 5.5% to 6.25% at launch, but we’re told this has now dropped to the bottom of guidance at 5.5%, giving a multiple of roughly 8.6 times the expected loss, which is particularly high and clearly designed to compensate investors for the two sections of reinsurance cover their capital and this cat bond will provide.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

These notes have a three-year expected loss of 0.35%, 0.12% annualised and we understand that expected losses would be capped at a maximum of 0.25% annualised under the terms of the cat bond.

This tranche has a three-year expected loss of 2.98%, 0.99% annualised and we’re told that expected losses would be capped at a maximum of 1.1% annualised under the terms of the deal.

However the pricing guidance has now been updated and one tranche has dropped to the bottom of guidance, while the other looks like it will settle at the mid-point.The $150 million Series 2018-1 tranche of Class A notes, which have a three-year expected loss of 0.35%, 0.12% annualised, and were initially offered to investors with coupon price guidance in a range from 1.75% to 2%, are now set to price at the mid-point with a coupon of 1.875%, we’re told.With this tranche, which are relatively remote in terms of risk, it’s possible that there is simply a minimum return that investors are looking for from a cat bond investment, no matter how low risk it is.The second $50 million Series 2018-1 Class B layer of notes, which are much riskier with a three-year expected loss of 2.98%, 0.99% annualised, and were offered to investors with pricing guidance in a range from 2.5% to 3%, are set to price at the low-end of that range, at 2.5%.Update – April 2021:As no qualifying loss events occurred during the first three-year aggregate risk period, sponsor Tokio Marine opted to redeem the full $200 million of notes from this catastrophe bond early, in April 2021.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Ltd. with reinsurance protection against losses from typhoons, floods and earthquake related fire events across Japan.Earthquake related fire risk is a new peril that, while included in many Japan quake cat bonds, has not been singled out on its own before. This tranche of notes does not cover earthquake shake damage, just the damage caused by fires following a quake event which is a major risk for many Japanese property insurers.The second tranche of Series 2018-1 Class B notes, which is current $75 million in size, will benefit only Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance Co., Ltd. with reinsurance protection against losses from just typhoons and floods in Japan.The $150 million Class A tranche of Akibare Re 2018-1 notes attach at JPY 360 billion for typhoon and flood events, but just JPY 10 billion for earthquake fire events. That gives these notes an initial attachment probability of 0.9%, an expected loss of 0.73% and as a result they are being offered to investors with a 2% to 2.5% coupon pricing range, we understand.The $75 million Class B tranche of Akibare Re 2018-1 notes attach at JPY 280 billion for the covered perils of typhoon and flooding, giving the notes an initial attachment probability of 1.09%, an expected loss of 0.99% and a marketed coupon price in a range from 2% to 2.5%.The price marks suggest multiples aligned with or perhaps a little lower than the last Akibare Re cat bond, where price multiples were about 2.1 times the expected loss.Update 1:We’re told that thanks to strong investor demand the transaction is now targeting up to $320 million of coverage for the insurers, while at the same time the price guidance has fallen for both of the tranches of notes being issued.The first tranche, which launched as a $150 million layer of Series 2018-1 Class A notes, will benefit only Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co. Ltd. with reinsurance protection against losses from typhoons, floods and earthquake related fire events across Japan.This tranche, with an expected loss of 0.73%, is now targeting between $200 million and $220 million of coverage for Mitsui Sumitomo and at the same time as upsizing the initial price guidance of 2% to 2.5% has been slashed to 1.9% to 2%, we understand.The second tranche began as a $75 million Class B layer, designed to benefit only Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance Co., Ltd. with reinsurance protection against losses from just typhoons and floods in Japan.This tranche, which has an expected loss of 0.99%, is now targeting $100 million of coverage for Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance and the initial coupon price guidance of 2% to 2.5% has again been slashed down to 1.9% to 2%.So both of the tranches of cat bond notes being issued by Akibare Re in this Series 2018-1 deal have seen their size increase while the pricing guidance has fallen to the bottom-end or below, thanks to strong investor demand.Update 2:We understand from sources that the upper end of the targeted size for the catastrophe bond was secured, at $320 million.The transaction now consists of a $220 million Series 2018-1 Class A tranche of notes that will benefit only Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co.

The notes have a 10-year term.These mortgage ILS transactions see primary mortgage insurer looking to the capital markets and ILS as a way to augment their reinsurance protection for mortgage insurance books, in a fully-collateralized transaction similar to a catastrophe bond or other insurance-linked security.At this stage it’s not clear if the protection is for Essent’s legacy mortgage book or a recently underwritten portfolio, but the end result is the same, a transfer of a portion of the mortgage insurance risk to capital markets investors.The capital market investors backing the $360.75 million of notes issued by Radnor Re 2018-1 are taking on the risk of Essent suffering mortgage insurance losses above a pre-defined indemnity trigger level on certain segments of its mortgage insurance portfolio, we understand.This transaction is split into three classes of notes, a $161.277 million M-1 tranche, a $178.253 million M-2 tranche and a $21.221 million class B-1 tranche which will be issued and sold to investors.These tranches of notes issued by Radnor Re 2018-1 will provide reinsurance totalling $360.75 million from this offering. These note tranches are exposed to the risk of reinsured losses on the mortgage insurance policies issued by Essent Guaranty, Inc., the ceding insurer under the terms of the transaction.The notes will cover mortgage insurance risk linked to a pool of $40.55 billion of insured mortgage loans, for which the mortgage insurance policy coverage amount totals $9.99 billion.Morningstar is set to rate the $360.75 million of mortgage insurance-linked notes that are being issued, and said of the deal, “Radnor Re 2018-1 is backed by reinsurance premiums and related account investment earnings and reversionary interests, in each case relating to a pool of mortgage-insurance policies linked to residential loans. The residential mortgage loans are insured against certain losses by mortgage insurance policies that are in turn subject to the coverage provided by the Reinsurance Agreement.“The pool of insured mortgage loans consists of fully amortizing, fixed-and variable rate, first-lien loans that have never been reported as in default as of the cutoff date.

(Series 2018-1) issuance.Zenkyoren, or the Japanese National Mutual Insurance Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives as it is known, is looking to secure at least $250 million of three-year aggregate reinsurance coverage against Japanese earthquake risks through the issuance of two tranches of Series 2018-1 cat bond notes through its Nakama Re Ltd. special purpose reinsurance vehicle.Nakama Re will aim to issue and sell two tranches of notes to ILS investors, the proceeds of which will be used to collateralise underlying reinsurance agreements that afford Zenkyoren with coverage against losses caused by earthquakes striking Japan, with the peril covered also including earthquake induced shaking, tsunami, fire, flood and sprinkler related water damage, we understand.The two tranches of notes seek very different levels of coverage, with one sitting at the lower-end of Zenkyoren’s reinsurance tower and the other nearer the top-end.While a three-year aggregate trigger, the transaction actually provides coverage until 2023, so across five years, with three overlapping risk periods of three years in length each.The first tranche to be issued is a $200 million sized Series 2018-1 Class 1, which is the lower risk layer and will cover Zenkyoren’s losses from JPY 2.15 trillion up to JPY 2.5 trillion. The riskier currently $50 million Class 2 tranche will cover losses from JPY 1.2 trillion up to JLY 1.5 trillion. Both tranches feature a JPY 270 billion franchise deductible, we’re told.The $200 million of Class 1 notes have an initial annualised attachment probability of 0.56%, an expected loss of 0.48% and are being offered to cat bond investors with pricing guidance of 2% to 2.2%, which is a little lower than the pricing of the 2016 Nakama Re Class 1 notes that cover a similar risk layer.The $50 million of Class 2 notes have an attachment probability of 1.79%, an expected loss of 1.44% and are being offered with spread guidance of 3% to 3.25%, which is again lower than their 2016 equivalent, the Nakama Re 2016 Class 2 notes.Update 1:The transaction has been upsized by 180% to $700 million during marketing, as investor demand for the Nakama Re 2018-1 cat bond also pushed the pricing down.Investor demand and Zenkyoren’s appetite for capital market protection has driven the target size much higher, with the deal now looking set to secure the insurer a $700 million chunk of reinsurance protection.At the same time as increasing the issuance size, we’re told the pricing on both tranches of Nakama Re 2018-1 cat bond notes has dropped to the bottom of the initial guidance.The now $500 million of Class 1 notes, which have an initial expected loss of 0.48% and were offered with pricing in a range from 2% to 2.2%, are now set to price at the bottom end of that range at 2%, we hear.The now $200 million of Class 2 notes, with an initial expected loss of 1.44% and that launched with coupon guidance of 3% to 3.25%, are likely to now price at the bottom-end as well, with a coupon of 3%.Update 2:The Nakama Re 2018-1 cat bond remained at $700 million in size at pricing and the coupons were both fixed at the bottom end of guidance, with the $500 million tranche of Class 1 notes, which have an initial expected loss of 0.48%, have now been priced with a 2% coupon, we understand.

Coverage will be across four annual risk periods, we understand.In this 2018 issuance, Vitality Re IX Ltd. is seeking to issue a $140 million tranche of Class A notes and a $60 million tranche of Class B notes, sources said. Both tranches are, as always with these health ILS deals, very remote in terms of risk.The $140 million Class A tranche of notes are designed to provide Aetna with reinsurance coverage for medical benefit claims losses from a medical benefit ratio attachment point of 100%, equivalent to an indemnity loss under the reinsurance of $1 billion, and an MBR exhaustion at 114%, equivalent to $1.14 billion. These notes have a modelled attachment probability equivalent to 0.03% and expected loss of less than 0.01%.The $60 million Class B tranche will cover losses from a medical benefit ratio of 94%, equivalent to an indemnity loss under the reinsurance of $940 million, to 100%, equivalent to $1 billion, so sit beneath the class A notes in the reinsurance tower and are slightly more risky as a result. This tranche has an initial attachment probability equivalent of 0.41% and an expected loss of 0.16%.Price guidance is low for both tranches, as you’d anticipate with such remote risks, and the Class A notes are set to offer investors a coupon in a range from 1.75% to 2.25%, while the Class B notes will offer a coupon from 2% to 2.75%.Interestingly, that is the same price guidance as the 2017 transaction launched with, although this new 2018 Vitality Re IX deal is slightly less risky.Update 1:Pricing was delayed for this Vitality Re IX transaction, due to the U.S. government shutdown and the fact the ACA health insurer fee was under consideration in the associated legislation.This was resolved with some amendments to offering documents, to allow for the fact the health insurer fee could change during the term of the bond.Update 2:Both tranches were priced at levels well below their initial guidance mid-points.The $140 million Class A tranche of notes which have an expected loss of less than 0.01% and are the least risky layer of reinsurance protection, launched with coupon price guidance in a range from 1.75% to 2.25%. This tranche of notes have now been priced with a coupon of just 1.6%, so below the starting guidance.The $60 million Class B tranche, which are riskier and have an expected loss of 0.16%, were launched to investors with a coupon guidance range of 2% to 2.75%, but this tranche has now been priced at 1.75%, so again well below the guidance range mid-point.These price points are very low even for the Vitality series of deals, which is clearly a reflection of ILS investor demand.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Series 2017-1 transaction.Tailwind Re Ltd. is a newly formed Bermuda special purpose insurer (SPI) established to issue series of catastrophe bond notes for the sponsor.In this first issuance, Tailwind Re Ltd. will offer three tranches of Series 2017-1 notes to cat bond investors, proceeds from the sale of which will be used to fully collateralized underlying reinsurance agreements with Validus companies.We’re told that the transaction will provide retrocession and reinsurance to Validus Re, Talbot Underwriting and its syndicate at Lloyd’s of London, Western World and other Validus Holdings subsidiaries.The Tailwind Re 2017-1 cat bond will provide the company with a capital markets backed source of collateralized reinsurance and retro covering the multiple perils of U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands named storms and earthquakes.The reinsurance protection from the Tailwind Re 2017-1 cat bond will run for a four-year period, protecting Validus on an annual aggregate basis and using a weighted PCS industry loss index trigger.Three cat bond tranches will be issued by Tailwind Re, all with different levels of risk and return for investors, but covering the same perils and territories on an industry loss basis, we understand.A $125 million Class A tranche of notes have an initial attachment point of 3.79%, expected loss of 3.41% and are offered to ILS investors with price guidance of 7.75% to 8.5%.A $125 million Class B tranche of notes are a little riskier, having an initial attachment point of 5.11%, expected loss of 4.43% and are offered to cat bond investors with price guidance of 9.5% to 10.25%.The final $75 million Class C tranche are the riskiest, with an initial attachment point of 6.24%, expected loss of 5.64% and are being offered to cat bond investors with coupon price guidance of 11.5% to 12.5%.We are told that each tranche will require an initial franchise deductible to be met before industry losses begin to accumulate to the index. We’re also told that this Tailwind Re cat bond would have faced losses during the Katrina, Rita, Wilma year of 2005, when the riskiest tranche would have paid out in full and the mid-risk tranche would have seen some loss of principal.Update 1:The Tailwind Re catastrophe bond from Validus has been upsized by approximately 23% to $400 million during marketing, with all three tranches increasing in size and the price guidance dropping to below the initially marketed range for each as well.The Class A tranche of Series 2017-1 notes from Tailwind Re were launched to investors as a $125 million offering, but this tranche has now grown to $150 million we understand.

A little riskier with an initial expected loss of 4.43%, these notes were marketed to cat bond investors with price guidance of 9.5% to 10.25%, but that has now dropped to 9% to 9.5%.The final Class C tranche are the riskiest and launched as a $75 million offering, but this has now grown to a $100 million layer of risk.

Hence these are the riskier of the two tranches, attaching first.The Class D notes have an initial attachment probability of 3.05%, an expected loss of 2.79% and are offered to investors with price guidance of 5% to 5.75%, we understand.These two tranches are the C and D notes from the Ursa Re Program Notes, a set of six cat bond tranches, that were modelled in advance of the issuance of its 2017-1 transaction in May 2017. We understand that by having pre-modelled and structured these six tranches, the CEA has had a structure it can compare with traditional reinsurance and fit better into its program at the right point in the year.With both the C and D tranches of notes covering a layer at least twice their current size, it looks like there is a significant chance that the CEA will increase the size of the issuance if investor demand allows it to. The pricing looks roughly aligned with its most recent issuance, likely also a benefit of having modelled these notes in advance.Update 1:Both tranches remain sized at $200 million, we understand, despite each covering a larger layer of risk ($400m for the Class C layer and $500m for the Class D) meaning there was plenty of room to upsize.But price guidance has now been fixed for the notes, with the Class C pricing put at 4%, so towards the upper end, and the Class D at 5.25%, so nearer the lower end.Looking back at pricing data from other Ursa Re cat bonds sponsored by the CEA in recent years and it is clear there is little pricing uplift in this catastrophe bond, despite it being one of the first after the recent major losses.The multiples are aligned with other transactions of the last few years. The Class C notes, with their multiple of 3 times expected loss, are very closely aligned with two other lower-risk tranches from 2016 and 2014, in terms of risk adjusted price. The Class D notes, which have a multiple of 1.88 times the expected loss, are priced below 2014 and 2015 tranches which have the closest risk profile.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

These are the riskiest notes of the Residential Re 2017-2 cat bond issue, with an initial attachment probability of 23.17%, or $400m of losses, and an expected loss of 15.75%. This one-year tranche of zero-coupon notes are being offered to investors at 78% to 80% of par value, we’re told, which approximates to a coupon of 20% to 22%.The Class 1 tranche of notes exclude Florida from the tropical cyclone peril definition, while the other two tranches cover USAA’s losses there.The Class 2 tranche of notes, preliminarily sized at $100 million and with a four-year risk period, have an attachment probability of 13.14%, or $700 million of losses to the sponsor USAA, and an expected loss of 7.33%. This tranche is being offered to investors with price guidance of 12.5% to 13.5% we understand.Lastly, a $75 million Class 3 tranche of notes will be issued with a four-year risk period as well. These notes will have an attachment probability of 4.04%, or $1.559 billion of losses, an expected loss of 2.84% and are offered to investors with coupon price guidance of 5.5% to 6.25% we’re told. This tranche of notes are set to be rated by S&P.Update 1:This cat bond looks set to upsize to approximately $285 million for USAA.The riskiest Class 1 tranche of notes, which is a one-year zero coupon layer and was sized at $50 million from launch, is now targeting up to $55 million, we understand. The pricing guidance on this tranche had launched at 78% to 80% of par value, but that has been narrowed now to 78% to 79% of par, we’re told, approximating a coupon of 20% to 21%.The Class 2 tranche launched targeting $100 million of reinsurance protection with price guidance of 12.5% to 13.5%. This tranche is still aiming for $100 million, but now the pricing has dropped to 12.5% to 13%, we understand.The final Class 3 tranche, which are the lowest risk, launched with a size target of $75 million and coupon price guidance of 5.5% to 6.25%. This tranche now targets $130 million, so all the upsizing is here in this lower risk layer, while the pricing guidance has been fixed at the bottom-end at 5.5%.Update 2:This cat bond eventually settled at $295 million in size, a 31% upsizing during the marketing of this deal to cat bond investors.The riskiest Class 1 tranche of notes grew to $55 million at pricing, with pricing set at 79% (the mid-point) of par value offering a coupon equivalent return of 21%.The Class 2, mid-risk, tranche eventually grew to $110 million, with pricing that settled at the lowest end of guidance at 12.5%.The final Class 3 tranche, the lowest risk, secured $130 million of protection, so the majority of the upsizing of this cat bond is here in this lower risk layer, while the coupon pricing settled at 5.5%, again the bottom of guidance.Update Dec 5th, 2018:The $55 million Class 1 tranche of this catastrophe bond was placed at-risk of losses and its maturity extended by three months, to March 6th 2019. The reason for the extension of maturity is assumed to be the 2018 California wildfires and USAA holding back this collateral while its losses from these events develop and become clearer. This Class 1 tranche of notes are the riskiest per-occurrence cat bond protection that USAA has.

(Series 2017-1) issuance.This is the first catastrophe bond transaction to be issued in the wake of the major hurricane losses in the 2017 season and the pricing guidance for each tranche of notes seems to reflect the fact that ILS investors have faced losses, with pricing looking set to be at a higher multiple level than recent cat bonds before the catastrophe losses.The Galileo Re 2017-1 cat bond features two tranches of notes, both of will provide XL Catlin subsidiaries with collateralised reinsurance protection for losses from U.S. named storms, U.S. earthquakes, Canadian earthquakes, U.S. severe thunderstorms, European windstorms, Australian tropical cyclones and Australian earthquakes.U.S. severe thunderstorm coverage is an addition to recent catastrophe bonds sponsored from XL, which have tended to cover all the other perils but not tornado and severe convective weather risks.This Galileo Re 2017-1 cat bond will provide its cover on a weighted industry loss and annual aggregate basis, with U.S triggers provided by PCS, while PERILS AG will provide industry loss trigger data for the European and Australian risks.The ceding insurer is XL Bermuda Ltd. but this global multi-peril reinsurance protection covers XL Catlin insurers, reinsurers and Lloyd’s of London syndicates, so it is a broad coverage providing peak peril coverage on an aggregate basis across the re/insurance group (so retrocessional and reinsurance in nature).A Galileo Re 2017-1 Class A tranche of notes has a preliminary size of $100 million, would attach at $360m and exhaust at $560m, with an initial attachment probability of 5.13%, expected loss of 3.37% and is being offered to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 7.5% to 8%, we understand.A $50 million sized Class B tranche of notes would attach at $160m and exhaust at $360m, so sitting beneath the A notes, with an initial attachment probability of 17.53%, an expected loss of 9.72% and a much higher coupon, with price guidance in a range from 17% to 17.5%.Both classes of notes will have a franchise deductible of $40 million and as each will cover a $200m layer of risk there is plenty of room for them to be upsized, should investor demand allow.Update 1:During marketing, the Class A tranche dropped in size to $75 million, we’re told, while their price guidance was fixed at the low end of guidance at 7.5%.But the riskier Class B tranche increased in size, to $75 million, however their price guidance moved to the top of the marketed range at 17.5%.It’s an interesting result, as it shows lower demand for the lower risk notes, although investors were prepared to accept a tightening of the spread on that Class A tranche.For the higher risk note the demand has clearly been higher, although investors have also demanded a higher spread, pushing the coupon to the top of the previously marketed range.This dynamic could reflect ILS investors desire to access higher returning business, in order to boost portfolio returns at a time when a significant portion of the outstanding cat bond market has been marked down.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The parametric trigger features boxes for each peril, with different levels of payout possible depending on where or how powerfully an earthquake or named storm strikes Mexico.A payout as low as 25% of the notes principal could be possible, under the terms the parametric trigger has been structured with.The currently $120 million sized CAR Series 113 Class A notes under this issuance will provide the parametric earthquake protection, across a three-year term, and can have a 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% payout, depending on a qualifying event’s characteristics. These earthquake linked notes have a modelled attachment probability of 5.73%, an expected loss of 3.43% and are going to be marketed to investors offering a risk margin (effective coupon) of between 5% and 5.5%, we understand.The Class B CAR Series 114 notes will provide Atlantic named storm protection and are sized at $85 million, with coverage over a three wind season term and a 25%, 50% or 100% payout possible. This tranche of notes have a modelled attachment probability of 7.97%, an expected loss of 5.56% and will be marketed offering a risk margin in a range from 9.9% to 10.5%.The final Class C Series 115 tranche will offer the Pacific named storm protection, and are also sized at $85 million with their coverage over a three wind season term and 25%, 50% or 100% payouts possible. This tranche has a modelled attachment probability of 5.8%, an expected loss of 3.96% and will be marketed offering a risk margin in a range from 6.5% to 7.1%.This parametric catastrophe bond transaction will provide FONDEN and the Mexican government with a source of risk transfer or insurance capacity that will be able to pay out more quickly than a traditional arrangement and with a trigger that should be relatively transparent.The parametric box arrangement is not perhaps as simple as other parametric cat bonds, but this has been structured so as to offer the maximum protection to the areas carrying the greatest exposure for the country.Update 1:The target size for this cat bond has been lifted by around 24% with the deal now looking to secure up to $360 million of capital market risk transfer for FONDEN.At the same time all three tranches of notes saw their sizes lift and their price guidance drop.The CAR Series 113 tranche of Class A notes are now targeting $140m to $150m in size and the pricing has fallen to below the initial range at 4.5% to 5%, we’re told.The $85 million Class B CAR Series 114 notes are now targeting $100 million of notes with risk margin guidance now lowered to 9.3% to 9.9%.The final $85 million Class C Series 115 tranche is set to grow to $100m to $110m while risk margin guidance has been reduced to 5.9% to 6.5%.Update 2:The CAR Series 113 tranche of Class A notes, offering parametric earthquake protection across a three-year term secured the upper end of its target at $150m. Meanwhile the pricing was fixed at the lowest end of reduced guidance at 4.5%.The Class B CAR Series 114 Atlantic named storm notes secured the $100 million of coverage. Pricing for this tranche settled at the bottom end of reduced guidance at 9.3%.The last tranche of Class C Series 115 Pacific named storm notes secured their $110m targeted size. The pricing was fixed at the bottom end of guidance at 5.9%.Update September 8th 2017:A magnitude 8.1 earthquake that struck off the coast of Chiapas, Mexico put the World Bank supported IBRD / FONDEN 2017 catastrophe bond at risk of being triggered.The location of the magnitude 8.1 earthquake fell within the parametric box of the catastrophe bonds $150 million Capital-At-Risk Series 113 tranche of Class A notes, which provide earthquake protection to the Mexico government.It appears that the notes will suffer a full loss of principal, paying out the entire $150 million. The cat bond market priced the notes down for a total loss.Update October 11th 2017:The Mexican government confirmed the Class A tranche of notes will pay out, after the calculation agent verified that the earthquake parameters of epicenter location, depth and intensity were sufficient to trigger the bond and cause a full $150m payout.Update October 22nd 2018:Hurricane Willa approached Mexico with sustained winds of 155 mph and a minimum central pressure of 931 mb, putting the storm as sufficiently intense to activate the parametric trigger for the Fonden 2017 catastrophe bond Class C Pacific named storm notes.The hurricane was forecast to maintain major status as it approaches the coast of Mexico and at 931 mb it would cause a 50% payout if that central pressure was sustained until it entered the parametric trigger zones. More details in our article breaking the news.Update October 23rd 2018:Hurricane Willa weakened slightly on approach to its Mexico landfall and as a result the minimum central pressure rose, taking it above the parametric trigger amounts required to cause a payout. As a result the Class C notes were safe from this particular storm.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

With both sections providing per-occurrence based reinsurance protection it means only one can ever pay out, so investors are not exposed to both loss categories at the same time.Of course this does make the work of analysing and modelling such a catastrophe bond harder for investors and may even limit the number of ILS funds and investors that would be capable of understanding the risks enough to participate, but given the sophistication of the ILS market now there are plenty of fund managers and investors that can.We’re told that the $100 million tranche of notes to be issued by Fortius Re II will have an initial attachment probability of 1.83% and an expected loss of 1.11%. The majority of that is derived from the Section A indemnity risk, with 0.84% of the expected loss, while the modelled loss section contributes just 0.18% of the expected loss, we are told.The Fortius Re II notes are being offered to ILS investors with coupon price guidance in a range from 4% to 4.5%, which is generous given the expected loss and likely compensates investors for supporting what is a more unusual cat bond coverage structure.Update 1:We’re told that while the size target remains $100 million, the pricing guidance has dropped to below the initial range and AmTrust is now targeting a coupon of between 3.75% and 4% at close.Update 2:The pricing finally settled at the bottom end of the already reduced guidance, to offer investors in the notes a coupon of 3.75%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The coverage is per occurrence and will run for a three-year term, we’re told.The IBRD will issue a Series 111 Class A tranche of notes which we understand to be targeting at least $75 million of coverage that will be linked to the outbreak of pandemic flu or coronavirus events, we understand. The Class A notes have an attachment probability of 4.92% and an expected loss of 3.57%, with the pricing marketed at 7.25% to 8%, we’re told.The Series 112 Class B tranche targets $25 million of cover or greater, we hear, but these notes are exposed to a wider range of pandemic perils, Coronavirus, Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, Filovirus, Lassa Fever and Rift Valley Fever. This tranche has an attachment probability of 9.44%, an expected loss of 7.74% and price guidance of 12.25% to 13%.Interest payments to investors will be funded by donor contributions to the PEF Trust Fund and any payouts due to the either series of notes parametric triggers being breached by a pandemic will result in capital flowing to the PEF for it to use in helping affected countries slow the spread of an event and recover.The World Bank’s first pandemic cat bond issuance to back the PEF is supported by major reinsurance players Swiss Re, Munich Re and reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter, with risk modelling from AIR Worldwide.These notes will back the developing Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) which is an initiative designed to rapidly disburse capital to countries in the event of deadly pandemics, with backing from risk transfer provided by the catastrophe bonds.Update 1:We’re told that the target size for the transaction has been lifted with as much as $400 million mooted, and a lower-end target of at least $175 million sought.A Series 111 Class A tranche of notes had launched targeting at least $75 million of coverage that will be linked to the outbreak of pandemic flu or coronavirus events, but this tranche is now targeting from $150 million to $200 million of cover. This tranche had launched with price guidance of 7.25% to 8%, but this has dropped to below that range now at 7% to 7.25%, we understand.A Series 112 Class B tranche was targeting $25 million of cover or greater, and the target is now set at between $25 million and $150 million, we hear. This tranche covers a wider range of pandemic perils, including Coronavirus, Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, Filovirus, Lassa Fever and Rift Valley Fever. As a riskier tranche of protection, these notes were offering price guidance of between 12.25% to 13%, but this has been lowered and tightened to 11.75% to 12.25%.Update 2:The targeted size range has narrowed to $175 million up to $350 million, we understand, while the spread guidance has dropped even further, now sitting well below where the initial pricing had been mooted.The Class A tranche is aiming for $150m to $250m of notes issued. On pricing, this tranche has now dropped even further to 6.9% to 7%.The Series 112 Class B tranche is now aiming for between $25m and $100m in size, we’re told. The pricing has now dropped again and narrowed to 11.5% to 11.75% we understand.Update 3:The transaction finally priced to offer $325 million of notes.The Class A tranche of notes was priced to offer $225 million of notes to investors, with pricing of 6.9% we understand. The Class B, riskier tranche, priced offering $95 million of notes at a bond coupon and risk margin of 11.5%.It’s also noteworthy that the World Bank sold $105 million of pandemic linked catastrophe swaps to capital market investors as well, in order to increase the reach of the transaction by helping other investors that preferred the derivative structure to access the risk as well.The World Bank revealed the investor breakdown for the distribution of the bonds, see below:Distribution by Investor Type Class AClass BDedicated Catastrophe Bond Investor61.7%35.3%Endowment3.3%6.3%Asset Manager20.6%16.3%Pension Fund14.4%42.1%Distribution by Investor LocationClass AClass BUS27.9%15.0%Europe71.8%82.9%Bermuda0.1%2.1%Japan0.2%0.0%Update, May 2018:The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Africa may prove to be an eligible event under the terms of the Series 112 Class B notes issued in this pandemic cat bond. The notes cover Ebola as a filovirus, but require a number of factors to be met, in terms of the number of deaths caused, the rate of spread and also the disease crossing borders, before any payout would be triggered.Update, December 2018:The number of confirmed deaths in the Congo Ebola disease outbreak has now passed the trigger point for a 30% payout of the $95 million of IBRD Capital-at-risk Series 112 Class B notes, but the notes have not yet been triggered as the other factors such as geographic spread across borders still haven’t been met.Update, June 2019:The risk that the World Bank’s pandemic catastrophe bond transaction triggers and makes a payout appears to have risen significantly, as the World Heath Organisation (WHO) reports that the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has now spread across the border to Uganda.With almost 1,400 confirmed deaths now, should the $95 million of Class B notes be triggered it would result in a 60% loss of principal.However, for any payout to be confirmed the spread still needs to meet a growth rate, in terms of the number of new cases confirmed. At this time no official determination has been made.This cat bond was not triggered by the Ebola virus outbreak.Update, February 26th 2020:The pressure is rising on the World Bank’s pandemic catastrophe bond transaction as the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or Covid-19) spreads internationally and the number of deaths in certain countries around the globe nears the trigger point.As of today, February 26th, there are said to be more than 81,000 cases of the coronavirus worldwide (over 78,000 of which are in China), with 2,763 deaths (2,715 in China). The WHO’s latest situation report from the 25th Feb. confirms 80,239 laboratory confirmed cases globally and 2,700 deaths.It is the spread to countries such as South Korea, Iran and Italy that is raising concerns though, as there are now 11 deaths reported in South Korea, 16 in Iran and 11 in Italy.The number of WHO confirmed deaths abroad from a pandemic is seen as one of the key inputs to the trigger of the World Bank’s pandemic catastrophe bonds.We understand that the outbreak in China meets the necessary terms of the catastrophe bond as a covered territory, with confirmed cases and deaths already exceed the numbers required to trigger the pandemic cat bond notes.But at least one other country needs to see deaths rising above the minimum triggering point of 20, in order for a trigger event to occur. With deaths in South Korea, Iran and Italy all rising, it seems increasingly likely that trigger condition will also be met.It is then harder for us to know whether the current outbreak meets the other trigger parameters, such as growth rate, but given the way the coronavirus is spreading it does seem likely to be at that level of severity.So, at this time it seems the threat to the holders of the pandemic catastrophe bond notes is rising, perhaps significantly, in line with the spread of this coronavirus outbreak. Read more.Update, February 27th 2020:Iran has now reported that deaths in the country from the coronavirus outbreak there have reached 26, which is higher than the trigger condition concerning international spread of any outbreak, further heightening the risk of default to the pandemic catastrophe bond notes.We have to stress here that this is the Iranian government’s figure, not the official WHO reported number that would be used to determine whether any default or payout was due. So while the number has surpassed the point required by the trigger, it would still need to be reported as such by the WHO and also be subject to a calculation agent review as well, before it would be determined whether a payout came due.But at 26 already it seems like we can consider that this second important trigger condition for the pandemic catastrophe bond will now be breached. Read more.Update, March 2nd 2020:The highest risk layer of notes is now marked down significantly, with some secondary marks on pricing sheets we’ve seen seeking bids as low as 5 cents on the dollar for the notes, a roughly 95% mark down and a significant drop from the 45 to 55 cents average bid of last week.The lower risk $225 million of Class A notes have also been marked down, with some pricing sheets marking this tranche of notes for bids as low as 75 to 80 cents, reflecting a 20% to 25% discount. Read more.Update, March 23rd 2020:As most trigger conditions have now been breached by the growing global Covid-19 coronavirus crisis, it now looks likely that the pandemic catastrophe bonds will face a loss.The Class A tranche would face a 16.67% loss of principal, the maximum for any coronavirus outbreak, so amounting to $37.5m.The Class B tranche would face a 100% loss of principal, so $95m.For the swaps, the percentages would be the same, so an $8.34m loss for the Class A pandemic risk-linked swaps and a $55m payout for the Class B swaps.That would amount to a $132.5 million payout for the pandemic catastrophe bonds and a $63.34 million payout for the pandemic risk-linked swaps, in total almost $196 million across both of the instruments that back the PEF’s insurance window.Update, April 9th 2020:Sources told us that the first calculation report from AIR Worldwide has not found a payout is due, as the growth rate factor is currently not positive and so the necessary parametric triggers have not yet been breached.The coronavirus pandemic was deemed an eligible event and so a calculation process was set off, given the virus outbreak has already breached the majority of parametric trigger factors necessary for a payout to be made.But the “exponential” growth rate, in terms of new coronavirus cases being confirmed, has to be deemed positive and this takes into account a range of IBRD/IDB countries.It is calculated by comparing the growth rate of the first week after the parametric trigger factors were breached with the next and so on, with rolling calculation agent processes running from then as long as the other factors remain true.The growth rate considers IBRD/IDA borrower countries, where still the coronavirus is not spreading as rapidly as is seen in countries in Europe, for example. In addition, as the growth rate has declined significantly in China, the source, this is also factored in to the calculation we understand and could be the reason for it not reading as positive.It seems likely the growth rate in these countries will accelerate, as the virus continues to gain a foothold in countries that are perhaps less well prepared to fight the outbreak.The calculation agent AIR will again run the growth rate calculation and deliver another event report on April 17th, we are told, which is therefore the next date that these pandemic cat bonds and swaps could be triggered.Update, April 17th 2020:The second running of the calculation agent process deemed that the growth rate had turned positive as of March 31st, so triggering the expected almost $196 million payout.At March 31st, which was the point at which the final trigger condition was met and the growth rate went positive, the IDA countries counted for less than 1% of the global coronavirus case load, which we understand was approximately 4,650 cases.The payout will be just under $196 million across the pandemic catastrophe bonds and also the pandemic swaps (or OTC derivatives) that were issued at the same time and are backed by reinsurance capital.It will consist of 16.67% of the $225 million from the Class A pandemic cat bond notes and $50 million from the Class A swaps ($37.5 million and $8.34 million), which could only payout a maximum of 16.67% of their principal for a coronavirus outbreak.In addition, 100% of the Class B layer, made up of $95 million of Class B pandemic cat bonds and $55 million of Class B swaps, will also now payout, a total loss for that tranche.So in total the payout coming due will be $195.84 million, which will be disbursed to the World Bank housed Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) and will be used to help some of the poorer nations of the world in their response to the worsening global coronavirus outbreak.As we explained in a previous article, the payout of cash from the pandemic risk-linked swaps can be made more quickly, after a 5 business day wait beyond the official triggering and we assume today’s date as that’s when the report came out.But for the pandemic cat bonds it could be a little longer, as officially that would normally be at an interest payment date, which are the 15th of the month, so May 15th being the next.But, we believe the World Bank will do what it can to disburse the money early, as there seems little reason to delay the payout to wait for another interest payment date when that interest payment could still be made anyway (although presumably this would need investor agreement, but they are likely to get that if it is asked for, we believe).Update, April 27th 2020:In an update, the World Bank said that the capital from the pandemic cat bond and swaps payout can begin to be disbursed to IDA countries as early as next week.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

A Class B tranche of notes targets $150 million of coverage, and is structured to provide per-occurrence coverage for second and subsequent loss events, we understand.Both tranches of notes will utilise an industry loss trigger, based on PCS reported insurance market losses for covered events. The Class B tranche will only become activated after a first qualifying loss is reported and it seems only be activated for a set two year period (except for in the final annual risk period), after which it would take another two events to trigger these notes.The $150 million of Class A, annual aggregate and industry loss triggered notes that will be issued by Spectrum Capital have an initial attachment probability of 3.64%, expected loss of 2.72% and are being marketed to cat bond investors with price guidance in a range from 6% to 6.75%, we are told.The $100 million of Class B, second and subsequent event and industry loss triggered notes, have an annualised attachment probability across the term of the deal of 0.89%, an expected loss of 0.69% and are offered with coupon guidance from 3.25% to 4%.Update 1:The price guidance has been narrowed for both tranches, with the Class A notes also seeing the price drop. The Class A notes were launched with coupon guidance in a range from 6% to 6.75%, but we understand this has been narrowed and fallen to 5.75% to 6%, so below the originally marketed range.Meanwhile the Class B notes which had initial price guidance of 3.25% to 4% have seen their pricing narrow towards the middle of that range, at 3.5% to 3.75%.We’re told the Spectrum Capital cat bond transaction could also be upsized before it closes, if the final pricing is conducive to doing so.

This tranche has now grown in size to $160 million, we understand.The Class A notes were launched with coupon guidance in a range from 6% to 6.75%, which then dropped to a narrowed 5.75% to 6% and this has now been fixed at the lowest end of reduced guidance, at 5.75% we’re told.The Class B tranche were launched at $150 million in size, aiming for per-occurrence retro reinsurance coverage against losses from second and subsequent qualifying events. This tranche has now jumped in size to $270 million.The Class B notes had initial price guidance of 3.25% to 4%, which then narrowed towards the middle of that range at 3.5% to 3.75%.

It’s the first cat bond where TWIA has added Texas severe thunderstorm protection to the covered perils, alongside Texas named storms.Again, German reinsurer Hannover Re is helping TWIA to bring this deal to market, acting as the ceding reinsurer in the transaction. TWIA will enter into a reinsurance agreement with Hannover Rück SE which will then enter into a retrocession agreement with Alamo Re Ltd. to effect the 2017-1 cat bond transaction.Bermuda domiciled SPI Alamo Re Ltd. will look to issue a single tranche of Series 2017-1 Class A notes, currently targeting a $250 million issuance, which will be sold to ILS and cat bond investors in order to collateralize a retrocessional reinsurance agreement between the issuer and Hannover Rück SE. Hannover Rück SE will in turn enter into a reinsurance agreement with TWIA to provide the coverage.The $250 million of notes issued by Alamo Re in this 2017-1 issuance will provide TWIA with a three-year source of fully-collateralized reinsurance protection against losses from named storms and severe thunderstorms in the state of Texas. The cat bond notes will feature an indemnity trigger and the reinsurance coverage will be on an annual aggregate basis.In order to become a qualifying event, under the terms of the Alamo Re 2017-1 cat bond deal, named storm or severe thunderstorm events must cause TWIA a loss of above $50 million in the covered area.We understand from sources that losses will attach to the notes only above an attachment point of $2.8 billion of losses, and cover up to an exhaustion point of $4.2 billion. In this layer the Alamo Re 2017-1 cat bond will sit alongside traditional reinsurance coverage, so should pricing be attractive there is plenty of room for TWIA to elect to upsize this deal.The initial attachment probability is 2.28% and the expected loss is 1.71%. We’re told the notes are being offered to investors with coupon price guidance of 3.9% to 4.4%.The Alamo Re 2017-1 cat bond will sit directly beneath the $700m of Alamo Re 2015-1 notes in TWIA’s reinsurance tower.While TWIA has opted to add severe thunderstorm risks into its 2017 cat bond, we understand that they make up a minimal proportion of the expected loss and that named storm risks remain the main exposure ILS investors will be assuming with this transaction.Update 1:We now understand from sources that the target size for this issuance has been increased, with TWIA now looking to secure somewhere from $350 million to as much as $400 million of reinsurance protection through the issuance of this Alamo Re 2017-1 cat bond.At the same time as the target size has been lifted, the price guidance on the notes has dropped, we’re told.We understand that this pricing has been lowered and narrowed, with the Alamo Re 2017-1 cat bond notes now offered with coupon guidance of 3.75% to 3.9%, so below the initially marketed range.Update 2:TWIA’s latest cat bond achieved the upsized $400 million target, representing growth of 60% on the initial issuance target size.The transaction has been priced, with a coupon of 3.75% set, so at the bottom end of the already reduced pricing range reflecting a good reduction in costs for TWIA in securing this reinsurance protection.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(FMTAC), the New York State-licensed captive insurer and subsidiary of the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).The new MetroCat Re 2017-1 cat bond sees the MTA expanding the coverage it will receive from the capital markets, as it adds earthquake coverage to the named storm induced storm surge risk it secured with its previous deal.This second MetroCat Re transaction will see a $125 million single tranche of Class A notes issued in order to fully collateralize the reinsurance agreements between the issuing vehicle and the captive First Mutual Transportation Assurance Co., which will in turn provide the insurance protection to the MTA.The notes are exposed to parametric factors associated with storm surges caused by named storms and also earthquake risks, both within the New York metropolitan area, across a three-year term.A range of calculation locations within the metro area of the city will be used to measure and report data on events that strike the region, with parametric trigger points set which if breached would determine whether a payout is due. Should an event occur the calculation agent will derive an index for the covered peril in question and if the index value breaches the trigger point a payout would occur. The protection is on a per-occurrence basis, so an event will either trigger a full payment or none.The MetroCat Re 2017-1 notes have an attachment probability of 2.25%, over the medium-term, and an expected loss of the same at 2.25%.

The Class B, lower risk tranche of notes, are being offered to investors with coupon price guidance in a range from 3% to 3.5%.A $300 million Class E tranche is riskier, attaching at $1.7 billion, covering a $500 million layer and having an initial attachment probability of 3.72% and expected loss of 3.33%. The Class E tranche is offered with price guidance of 5.25% to 6%. The pricing multiple on this tranche will make this a very efficient layer of coverage for the CEA, if pricing settles within guidance.An interesting feature of this cat bond issuance is the use of ‘Program Notes.’ Six tranches were actually structured and modelled, with the lest risky a Class A and running up to Class F, but only the B and E tranches were issued at this time.The CEA can elect to issue any of the other tranches of notes, A, C, D, or F, in future issuances at any time prior to the end of the final risk period of the deal. That provides the CEA with ready-modelled and structured tranches of cat bond notes that could be issued to increase the capital markets participation in its reinsurance program, increasing the efficiency of future visits to the cat bond market.Update 1:We’re told the CEA’s target for this transaction is now for up to a $900 million issuance across the two tranches of notes.We’re told that the pricing has not dropped, as has been seen with so many other recent cat bonds.

These notes are marketed with coupon guidance of 9.25% to 10%, we understand.Update 1:We understand that all four tranches of notes have increased in size during the marketing process, with the total cat bond deal size now expected to grow by 25% to reach $375 million.At the same time investors have shown their appetite for new cat bonds once again, helping pricing fall to the bottom of guidance across all tranches.The Class A tranche of notes launched at $60 million has grown to $75 million in size, we’re told, while the initial coupon price guidance of 3.25% to 3.75% has now been lowered to the bottom of that range at 3.25%.The $120 million Class B tranche has grown to $150 million in size, while the launch price guidance of 4.5% to 5% is now set to complete at the lower end of 4.5%.The $60 million Class C tranche has grown to $75 million in size, while the price guidance of 6.5% to 7.25% has dropped down to the bottom at 6.5%.Finally, the riskiest $60 million Class D tranche has also grown to $75 million, while its coupon guidance of 9.25% to 10% has fallen again to the bottom at 9.25%.Update 5th December 2017:2017 catastrophe events look set to trigger this aggregate multi-peril catastrophe bond, as Nationwide Mutual’s loss estimates have now risen above the trigger for the riskiest Class D notes.Sources told us that an update to catastrophe loss estimates from Nationwide Mutual today shows that its aggregated losses in the current risk period have now reached approximately $1.77 billion and after accounting for a $50 million franchise deductible for one loss event, the qualifying aggregated losses are now approaching $1.73 billion.The $75 million Class D tranche of notes issued by Caelus Re V are the riskiest, attaching at $1.5 billion and covering losses up to $1.75 billion.As a result, based on where the loss estimate currently sits, it looks likely that this Caelus Re V 2017-1 Class D tranche of cat bond notes is heading for a total loss, which could add another $75 million to the 2017 ILS market loss toll.Update, February 22nd 2018: The latest loss report, which was published on February 15th and features loss data up to the end of 2017, shows that Nationwide’s groun-up losses have now reached roughly $1.91 billion, with increases from the California wildfires largely the reason for the rise, especially the Thomas wildfire in December.The riskiest $75 million Class D tranche of notes issued by Caelus Re V are now set to become a total loss, as they attach at $1.5 billion and covered losses up to $1.75 billion for Nationwide.Investors in the Class C tranche of Caelus Re V notes, which sit directly above Class D, are now also set to experience losses, with the ground-up loss tally now having eaten roughly 63% through that layer, which attached at $1.75 billion and cover losses to $2 billion.The ground-up loss total suggests that currently the also $75 million Class C tranche of Caelus Re V notes now face around a $47 million loss of principal.Update April 2018:Nationwide Mutual’s ground-up catastrophe losses continue to increase, with sources saying they now sit at around $2 billion and hence the Class B tranche of this deal is now also seen as at risk.As the situation now stands and including qualifying losses from winter storm Riley impacts, Nationwide Mutual’s ground-up aggregate catastrophe losses are around $2 billion, sources said.Some investors we’ve spoken with said that there is an expectation that Nationwide Mutual will also likely be able to include some severe thunderstorm losses within its aggregate before the end of the current risk period, at May 31st, which suggests the ground-up loss total could creep even higher, which puts a third tranche of Caelus Re V 2017 cat bond notes at risk as well.If losses surpass the $2 billion mark, which we’re told is almost a given, then the $150 million Class B tranche of notes issues by Caelus Re V in the 2017 deal also come into play, as they attach at $2 billion and cover losses up to $2.5 billion for Nationwide.With recent severe weather in the United States assumed to have caused a reasonable level of losses in Q1 and now also in Q2, there is a good chance that Nationwide may find it can add some of the impacts of recent convective storm events to its aggregate loss amount, triggering the Caelus Re V 2017-1 Class B notes as well.Should there be further deterioration of its losses from prior events, such as the hurricanes and wildfires in 2017, then the aggregate catastrophe loss total could rise even further, placing more ILS investor capital at risk.Currently, brokers secondary pricing sheets suggest that the $150 million of Caelus Re V 2017-1 Class B notes are definitely at-risk, with them marked down between 10% and 20% on sheets we’ve seen. So right now that suggests the potential for another $15 million to $30 million of cat bond losses to be added to the Class C and D tranches $150 million.Update July 2019:The riskiest tranche of the Caelus Re V 2017 cat bond issuance is the $75 million of Class D notes, which at issue had an expected loss of 4.86%.We understand that Nationwide’s reported estimate of aggregate UNL for the risk periods in question now stand far beyond where the exhaustion point for this tranche of notes stands.So that suggests a full reinsurance recovery will be made at some point in the future, once the firm loss figures are in from Nationwide.But for now the insurer has made a claim for a $10.73 million reinsurance recovery, or loss payment, under the Caelus Re V Series 2017-1 Class D tranche of notes, leaving just slightly under $64.27 million of the notes net principal still outstanding for now.Sources told us that Nationwide’s estimated aggregate ultimate net losses for the annual risk period running from June 2017 now stand at just above $2.168 billion.The figure actually fell slightly at an update as of the end of May, but it’s still far above where the exhaustion point sits for the Caelus Re V 2017 Class D notes.In fact, we’re told the aggregate UNL is also above the exhaustion point for the Caelus Re V 2017-1 Class C notes, which sit above the D’s in the reinsurance tower for Nationwide.As a result, the market is expecting a total loss of principal for the $75 million Class C notes as well.In addition, our sources said that the Class B notes are also at risk, with the $150 million tranche of notes currently looking likely to lose as much as one-third of their outstanding principal.The secondary market continues to suggest a higher loss than that for the Caelus Re V 2017-1 Class B tranche, with the notes priced for bids as low as 25 cents on the dollar, suggesting a roughly 75% loss of principal could be possible.However, given the aggregate UNL figure reported by Nationwide reduced at the end of May, it is possible that the secondary price on these Class B notes may rise a little now, as the outlook for them looks slightly improved at this time.Nevertheless, it seems given where the UNL figure stands that at least a total loss and reinsurance recovery is to be expected for the Caelus Re V 2017-1 Class C and D notes, with as much as one-third of the Class B set to face a loss as well.In total that could be a $200 million reinsurance recovery coming for Nationwide (the full $75m for each of tranche C and D, plus as much as $50m for tranche B), which will be welcomed by the insurer and its stakeholders.Update August 2019:Nationwide has made a second recovery under the riskiest tranche of the Caelus Re V 2017 cat bond issuance, the $75 million of Class D notes.The second loss payment was for $10.3 million, taking total recoveries made to-date under this tranche to roughly $21.03 million and leaving just under $53.98 million principal outstanding remaining from the Class D notes.Update September 2019:Nationwide made a third recovery under the Class D tranche of notes, taking total loss payments to almost $25 million from this tranche and leaving $50.4 million of principal outstanding.Update October 2019:Nationwide has made a further $8.85 million recovery under the Class D tranche of notes issued by Caelus Re V, taking total loss payments to arounnd $33.4 million and leaving just under $41.6 million of principal outstanding.Update December 2019:Nationwide received a fifth loss payment from the Caelus Re V Class D catastrophe bond notes, with an $8.457 million reinsurance recovery made.That takes total recoveries from what was originally a $75 million tranche of notes to almost $41.9 million, with the remaining outstanding principal of the Class D tranche falling further to just over $33.13 million.Update, June 2020:Half of the outstanding principal from the $150 million Class B tranche of notes of this issuance have been returned in a partial redemption, but the remaining $75 million of principal has now been retained and extended through to June 2024.Similarly, the full $75 million of Caelus Re V 2017-1 Class C notes, which haven’t yet faced any losses, have also had their principal retained and maturity extended through to June 2024.Finally, the remaining just over $33.13 million of the Class D notes, what is left after the reinsurance recoveries made so far, has also now had its maturity extended to June 2024.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

These are the riskiest notes of the Residential Re 2017 issue, with an initial attachment probability of 16.22%, or $883m of losses, and an expected loss of 14.06%. This one-year tranche of zero-coupon notes are being offered at 82.5% to 83.5% of par value, we’re told, which approximates to a coupon of 16.5% to 17.5%.A Class 11 tranche of notes, preliminarily sized at $150 million, and with a four-year risk period have an attachment probability of 4.56%, or $1.28 billion of losses, and an expected loss of 2.11%. This tranche is being offered to investors with price guidance of 4.75% to 5.25% we understand and will not be rated.Finally, a $100 million Class 13 tranche of notes will be issued with a four-year risk period as well. The Class 13 notes will have an attachment probability of 0.99%, or $2.05 billion of losses, an expected loss of 0.59% and are offered to investors with coupon price guidance of 3% to 3.5% we’re told. This tranche of notes are being rated, which is now becoming a rarity in the world of catastrophe bonds and have received a preliminary BB-(sf) rating from Standard & Poor’s.Update 1:USAA’s latest Residential Re has been received well by investors, helping the insurer lift the target size of the issue by 50% to up to $450 million.The Class 10 tranche of notes to be issued by Residential Reinsurance 2017 are now targeting between $40 million and $50 million of coverage, and this zero-coupon slice of cover has actually seen its pricing move out. This tranche was initially targeting $50 million at an offering price of 82.5% to 83.5% of par, but we now understand the price to have been fixed at 82.5%, equating to a 17.5% coupon.The Class 11 notes, which began their life with a preliminary size of $150 million, are now targeting from $200 million to $250 million, we’re told. The pricing on this tranche, which launched with price guidance of 4.75% to 5.25%, now sits at a narrowed 4.75% to 5%.Finally, the Class 13 tranche of notes, which began as a $100 million layer with coupon price guidance of 3% to 3.5%, now targets $125 million to $150 million and has price guidance at a narrowed towards the bottom of guidance 3% to 3.25%.Update 2:The Residential Re 2017-1 cat bond transaction is now set for completion with finalised tranche sizes and pricing now released to the market, we’re told, with the total deal-size now set to be $425 million.The Class 10 zero-coupon tranche of notes to be issued by Residential Reinsurance 2017 are set to complete at their initial target size of $50 million, while final pricing is set at 82.5%, equating to a 17.5% coupon. This is actually the upper end of initial guidance, as the tranche was offered with a discount range of 82.5% to 83.5%.The Class 11 notes, which began their life with a preliminary size of $150 million and then targeted $200 million to $250 million, have settled at $225 million, we understand. The pricing was initially 4.75% to 5.25%, then narrowed to 4.75% to 5% and has now been finalised at the low-end of that range, at 4.75%.The final Class 13 tranche of notes was initially a $100 million layer with coupon price guidance of 3% to 3.5%, then targeted $125 million to $150 million and we are told is set to complete at $150 million. The pricing will complete at the bottom end of the narrowed 3% to 3.25% range, to offer investors a 3% coupon.Update, October 31st 2017:USAA’s losses from catastrophe events in the current risk period now look set to trigger the riskiest Class 10 tranche of notes from this Residential re 2017-1 catastrophe bond.USAA has reported a loss estimate of $147 million for hurricane Harvey and the mid-point of USAA’s initial estimated range of losses from hurricane Irma is $316 million, giving a $463 million total from the hurricane season, to-date.USAA has also reported its initial losses from the California wildfires, the mid-point of the per-occurrence range reported works out on an aggregate basis as $442 million, we’re told.Together, the losses from hurricanes and wildfires total a preliminary $905 million, which is above the attachment point for the Class 10 notes of $883 million.The $50 million of Class 10 notes cover a 50% share of a $100 million layer of USAA’s reinsurance program, meaning that the $905 million of losses currently suggests an impact to noteholders of around $11 million.Updates to loss estimates will change this and the notes will remain on risk until end of May 2018. That means there is plenty of time for the 2017/18 winterstorm season and 2018 convective storm season to add additional aggregate losses, potentially wiping out this tranche of notes.Update, March 23rd 2018:USAA’s aggregated losses from catastrophe events in the current risk period have now reached roughly $1 billion, suggesting that these 2017-1 Class 10 notes are triggered and if the estimates remain unchanged investors will face losses. With some months left until the end of the risk period and the next reset, there is the potential for noteholders of this tranche to face a total loss of principal.Update, August 29th 2018:The $50 million of Class 10 notes have had their maturity extended again to December 6th 2018.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

It also allows State Farm to build deeper relationships with key ILS investor markets, especially those that also participate in its traditional reinsurance renewal.The covered perils ceded to ILS investors through this Merna Re 2017 cat bond are U.S. earthquake risks (likely covering the New Madrid fault region in the mid-west where State Farm has a significant exposure), the same peril as the insurers last few transactions.State Farm’s $300m Merna Re V cat bond, which covered New Madrid earthquakes, matures on the 7th April 2017, so we assume this Merna Re 2017-1 transaction is a renewal for that slice of coverage.The Merna Re 2017-1 cat bond notes will feature an indemnity trigger, given State Farm’s cat bonds in recent years have all provided the insurer with a source of indemnity reinsurance protection.The Merna Re 2017-1 cat bond has a three-year term, with the notes coming due for maturity at the 8th April 2020.Other facts on this transaction such as expected loss, attachment point and pricing are not known at this stage, due to the private nature of the deal.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Syndicates are often one of the beneficiaries of cover, through an insurance or reinsurance group sponsor, but direct or sole syndicate sponsors haven’t been seen in many years (the last we recorded was in 2002).Buffalo Re Ltd. is a newly established special purpose insurer set up to issue catastrophe bonds on behalf of ICAT.This Buffalo Re 2017-1 cat bond issue sees ICAT Syndicate 4242 seeking a fully collateralised source of reinsurance protection against losses from U.S. named storms and U.S. earthquakes, over a three-year risk period.Buffalo Re Ltd. is set to issue two tranche of notes we understand, with both exposed to named storms across the main tropical storm and hurricane exposed U.S. states and earthquakes across the entire U.S. and District of Colombia.Protection will be afforded on an indemnity trigger and per-occurrence basis, with the protection from the two tranches cascading, so one dropping down to replace the other when fully eroded, we understand. An inuring reinsurance layer also exists beneath the cat bonds we’re told.A Buffalo Re 2017-1 Class A tranche of notes have a preliminary size of $75 million and will attach at $70 million of losses, protection ICAT 4242 up to an exhaustion at $370 million of losses. This tranche of notes have an attachment probability of 2.29% and an expected loss of 1.18%.A Buffalo Re 2017-1 Class B tranche are sized at $50 million. These notes will attach at $70 million of losses to ICAT 4242 and exhaust at $240 million. These notes have an attachment probability of 6.98% and an expected loss of 4.09%, so are riskier and essentially the first that would be eroded by losses, with the Class A note cover cascading down at that point.In terms of pricing guidance, the less risky Class A notes are offered to investors with coupon guidance of 3.25% to 3.75%, we’re told. The riskier Class B notes will offer investors a coupon in the range of 7.25% to 7.75%.Given the size of the layers each tranche covers there is significant room for ICAT Syndicate 4242 to elect to upsize this cat bond issuance if it chooses, so expanding the percentage of each layer reinsured via Buffalo Re Ltd.Update 1:The latest deal update shows that the Buffalo Re 2017-1 cat bond issuance has upsized by almost 32%, to now offer investors $164.5 million of notes.The Buffalo Re 2017-1 Class A tranche of cat bond notes has grown to $105 million in size, we understand, while the Class B tranche has increased to $59.5 million.The now $105 million of Class A notes were initially offered to investors with price guidance of 3.25% to 3.75%, but this has now been reduced to the lower end at 3.25%.Meanwhile, the now $59.5 million of Class B notes, that were initially offered with guidance of 7.25% to 7.75%, have seen their pricing fall even further with the revised range now set at 6.75% to 7%, we understand.Update 2:At final pricing the two tranches both settled at the bottom of reduced guidance.This $105 million Class A tranche priced at the 3.25% spread, so the lowest end of initial guidance. The $59.5 million of Class B notes saw the coupon settle also at the low end of reduced guidance at 6.75%.The Class A notes have an expected loss of 1.18% initially, so with pricing of 3.25% that implies a multiple to investors of 2.75x.

The Class 2 tranche, with two sections for per-occurrence earthquake and aggregate convective storm losses, is considerably riskier and will pay investors a coupon of 12%. The attachment point for the Class 2 convective storm section is $190m of losses.Cincinnati Insurance also entered into an additional $20 million three-year collateralised reinsurance contract for further U.S. earthquake protection, which takes the total collateralised earthquake protection from this arrangement to $200 million.Update:Cincinnati Financial reported that severe convective storm activity in 2017 had eroded the deductible sitting beneath the SCS section of the Class 2 notes.By the end of Q1 2017 the aggregated qualifying losses had reached $106 million, with three severe thunderstorm events largely to blame. The tally rose further to $119 million by the end of Q2 2017.With the attachment point for the severe convective storm section of the Class 2 notes sitting at $190m the deductible had been 62% eroded by the 30th June 2017.Update, April 2018:Cincinnati Financial reported that severe convective storm activity in the first-quarter of 2018 had eroded the deductible sitting beneath the severe convective storm section of the Class 2 notes by $23 million.Three convective storm outbreaks qualified and their losses surpassed the per-occurrence deductible during the period, once again heightening the risk that future storm impacts could eroded the deductible further.Update, July 2019:Cincinnati Financial said that in the first-half to June 30th 2019, six specific severe convective storm events qualified under the terms of the cat bond and in each case their losses exceeded the $8 million per-occurrence deductible that is in place.Aggregate losses across those six storm events reached $141 million, after the deductible, which is just over 74% of the way to the $190 million attachment point for the Skyline Re 2017 Class 2 notes $80 million layer of reinsurance coverage.The fully collateralized reinsurance Skyline Re’s Class 2 notes provide Cincinnati would allow it to make a recovery from the bonds investors if losses, after the deductible, exceeded $190 million during this last of the issuance’s annual risk periods.Update, October 2019:Aggregate losses continued to qualify and beat the deductible, leading the insurer to report that by the end of Q3 2019 eight storm events where losses were above the $8 million deductible had met the requirements for recovery, aggregating to $150 million of losses, so now 79% of the way towards the cat bond trigger.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

These notes have a modelled attachment probability equivalent to 0.04% and expected loss of just 0.01%.A $60 million Class B tranche will cover losses from a medical benefit ratio of 96% to 102%, so sit beneath the class A notes in the reinsurance tower. This tranche has an initial attachment probability equivalent of 0.5% and an expected loss of 0.19%.Price guidance is, as you’d expect for such remote risks, low for both tranches, with the Class A notes set to offer investors a coupon in a range from 1.75% to 2.25% and the Class B notes a coupon from 2% to 2.75%.Standard & Poor’s said it had assigned a preliminary rating of BBB+(sf)’ to the Class A notes and ‘BB+(sf)’ to the Class B notes.S&P noted that the main driver of financial fluctuations has been “volatility in per-capita claim cost trends and lags in insurers’ reactions to these trend changes in their premium rating increase actions.” Changes in expenses and target profit margins are also cited as potential causes of volatility to the covered health insurance business, however for these Vitality Re deals the extreme tail risk is a severe pandemic.This is the second Vitality Re ILS from Aetna to feature a variable reset facility, enabling the insurer to adjust the probability of attachment of the notes to higher or lower than at issuance, S&P explains.“For each reset of the class A notes, if any class B notes are outstanding on the applicable reset calculation date, the updated MBR attachment of the class A notes will be set so it is equal to the updated MBR exhaustion for the class B notes,” the rating agency explained.Update 1:Both tranches of the deal saw enough investor appetite to drive the coupon down to the base-line of price guidance, with coupons falling to the low end of guidance.The $140 million Class A tranche of notes, which will provide reinsurance protection to Aetna for losses from a medical benefit ratio (MBR) attachment point of 102% up to an MBR exhaustion at 116%, have priced at the bottom end of the marketed 1.75% to 2.25% range, so at 1.75% we hear.Meanwhile, the $60 million Class B tranche, which covers losses from an MBR of 96% to 102%, have priced at 2%, again the bottom of the initial guidance range (2% to 2.75%).Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

These notes are offered with price guidance of 5.75% to 6.5%.A $125m Series 2017-1 Class D-2 tranche of notes will cover losses from $800m to $1bn for the ceding insurer, with an attachment probability of 2.25% and an expected loss of 1.86%. These notes are offered with price guidance of 4.5% to 5.25%.Finally, a $125m Series 2017-1 Class E-2 tranche of notes will cover losses from $1bn to $1.2bn for the ceding insurer, with an attachment probability of 1.54% and an expected loss of 1.29%. These notes are offered with price guidance of 3.75% to 4.5%.So, if the transaction hits targets, both series of the Galilei Re catastrophe bond will provide a $1 billion source of layered multi-peril catastrophe reinsurance coverage, collateralised by the capital markets and covering losses for XL Catlin companies right the way from an attachment point of $200m up to an exhaustion point of $1.2 billion.Update 1:This Galilei Re 2017-1 cat bond upsized slightly to $525 million before close.

(Series 2016-1) cat bond sees American Strategic looking for per-occurrence coverage, when the Gator Re cat bond was structured on an annual aggregate basis and covering the kind of frequency risk most suitable to such deals.With Bonanza Re 2016-1, the insurer is seeking to secure a targeted $200 million of fully collateralised reinsurance coverage using a top and drop indemnity structure, to provide reinsurance protection against major catastrophe events that could impact the firm. The term of the coverage would be two and a half years, running from June 2017 to the end of December 2019.Two classes of notes are on offer. A Series 2016-1 Class A tranche being marketed under the Bonanza Re Ltd. special purpose insurer seeks $150 million of investor capital to provide American Strategic with coverage against both U.S. named storm, for all tropical storm and hurricane exposed states, and severe thunderstorm risk for the 48 continental states and the District of Columbia.Meanwhile a $50 million Series 2016-1 Class B tranche of notes seeks purely U.S. named storm coverage, for the same covered area as Class A, but are a riskier tranche of notes with a higher attachment probability.The $150m of Class A notes, which cover both U.S. named storm and thunderstorm risks, have an attachment probability of 2.22%, attaching at $50m of qualifying indemnity losses and exhausting at $150m, and an expected loss of 1.52%, we understand. This tranche is being offered to investors with price guidance of between 4% and 5%.The $50m Class B U.S. named storm only tranche are riskier with an attachment probability of 4.08%, attaching at $25m and exhausting at $75m, and an expected loss of 2.19%, while the price guidance for this set of notes is between 5.5% and 6%.With both tranches offered as indemnity per-occurrence, with a top and drop feature, this moves away from the Gator Re deal which was aggregate in nature and so exposed investors to attritional severe thunderstorm risks such as hail events.This Bonanza Re cat bond covers more severe catastrophe events, meaning that it would take more meaningful single event impacts to American Strategic and its subsidiaries for any investor to face a loss.While this cat bond is set to be issued in December the risk period only begins in June 2017, so enabling American Strategic to secure a core piece of its catastrophe reinsurance program in advance from the capital markets and take advantage of investor appetite.Update 1:Coupon price guidance for the $200 million Bonanza Re Ltd. (Series 2016-1) catastrophe bond issuance, that is being marketed to investors on behalf of sponsor and ceding insurer American Strategic Insurance Group, has dropped to below the initial range once again reflecting strong investor demand.The Class A notes were being offered to investors with price guidance of between 4% and 5%, but this tranche has had its price guidance updated and lowered, with the notes now offered to investors with coupon guidance of 3.75% to 4%, we understand.The $50m Class B tranche of notes had price guidance at launch of between 5.5% and 6%, but this tranche has had its coupon guidance lowered as well, with the Class B Bonanza Re notes now offered to investors with guidance of 5% to 5.5%.Update 2:The Class A notes priced at 3.75%, the bottom of the already reduced coupon range. With a 2.22% attachment probability and an expected loss of 1.52%, this Class A tranche will offer investors a multiple of 2.5 times the expected loss.The Class B tranche were priced with a coupon of 5%, again at the bottom of the reduced range. With an attachment probability of 4.08% and an expected loss of 2.19%, this tranche will offer investors a multiple of almost 2.3 times the expected loss.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

They are being marketed to the ILS investor base with price guidance in the range of 3.25% to 4%, we’re told.We understand that the notes will cover losses across a $500 million layer of the CEA’s reinsurance program, which perhaps signals that there is room for this Ursa Re 2016-1 cat bond to grow if investor support is strong.Update 1:The CEA lifted its ambitions for this catastrophe bond, to a target size of between $330m and $500m of notes.At the same time the price guidance on this Ursa Re 2016-1 cat bond was tightened towards the upper end of guidance, to a range of 3.75% to 4%.Update 2:The Ursa Re 2016-1 cat bond has been priced and the CEA has achieved the 67% increase in size of the transaction to $500 million. At the same time the pricing on the $500 million of cat bond notes has settled at the top-end of initial guidance.When this Ursa Re cat bond was launched the pricing was set in a range of 3.25% to 4%, but was subsequently tightened during marketing to a 3.75% to 4% range.

All three of the classes of notes will be exposed to tropical cyclone risks (including renter policy flood cover), earthquake (including fire following), severe thunderstorm, wildfire, winter storm, volcanic eruption, meteorite impact and “other perils” across the U.S.Coverage from all three classes of notes will be on a per-occurrence basis and each tranche will feature an indemnity trigger. One of the three tranches will provide coverage over just a single risk period for one year, while the other two will provide USAA with multi-peril reinsurance protection over a four year term.The $80m Class 2 tranche of notes has the single year term and are structured as zero-coupon discount notes, Artemis understands. This is typically the case when an issuer wants to test ILS investors ability to take on a more reinsurance type of layer, so single year and using the discount structure to pay investors premiums upfront, through discounting the cost of the notes.The Class 2 notes will have a modelled attachment probability of 7.53% (that’s an attachment point of $1.015bn) and an expected loss of 5.55% base and 6.35% at the sensitivity case, and will be offered to investors at a 91% to 91.75% discount to par (implying an 8.25% to 9% coupon equivalent). These are the riskiest tranche with the lowest multiple equivalent.A $100m Class 3 tranche of notes will have a four year term, with an attachment probability of 4.12% (equivalent to a $1.539bn attachment point), an expected loss of 2.91% at the base case or 3.29% sensitivity, and are being marketed to investors with coupon guidance of 5.75% to 6.5%.Finally, a $100m Class 4 tranche of notes are the least risky of the three, providing their reinsurance ocver over a four year term, with an attachment probability of 2.13% (or $2.3bn of losses to USAA), a base expected loss of 1.53% and a sensitivity case EL of 1.72%. This tranche of notes are being offered to investors with price guidance of 4% to 4.75%, we’re told.Update 1:USAA is seeking to upsize its latest catastrophe bond issuance, with the Residential Reinsurance 2016 Ltd. (Series 2016-2) transaction now targeting from $280m to $400m of reinsurance coverage for the firm and sources said that price guidance has been reduced on all three tranches.The Class 2 tranche of Series 2016-2 notes being issued by Residential Re have not upsized and remain targeting $80m of cover. This tranche only has a one-year term and are structured as zero-coupon discount notes.The Class 2 notes were initially offered to investors at a 91% to 91.75% discount to par (implying an 8.25% to 9% coupon equivalent), but this has tightened to 91.75% to 92.25% we understand, which implies a coupon equivalent in the range of 7.75% to 8.25%. This is the riskiest tranche of this Residential Re cat bond.Meanwhile a Class 3 tranche of notes which have a four-year term launched targeting $100m of coverage, but now target $100m to $150m, we understand. This tranche launched with coupon guidance of 5.75% to 6.5%, but this has been reduced to 5.25% to 5.75% we’re told.The final tranche, of Class 4 notes which also have a four-year term and are the least risky of the three, began life at $100m but now target between $100m and $170m of reinsurance cover for USAA. This tranche of notes launched with price guidance of 4% to 4.75%, but this has been reduced to 3.5% to 4%.So USAA looks set to secure as much as $400m of reinsurance protection from the capital markets with this Residential Re 2016-2 cat bond deal and at reduced pricing, with all three tranches seeing guidance dropping to below the launch range.Update 2:This cat bond achieved the upsize to $400m of cover for USAA, while the pricing settled at the lowest ends of reduced guidance for all three tranches.The $80m Class 2 tranche of notes, which didn’t upsize, are structured as zero-coupon discount notes and have a one-year term. These were at first offered to investors at a 91% to 91.75% discount to par (implying an 8.25% to 9% coupon equivalent), which tightened to 91.75% to 92.25% or a coupon equivalent in the range of 7.75% to 8.25%. These notes settled at a discount to par of 92.25%, so a 7.75% coupon equivalent.The Class 3 tranche of notes which have a four-year term upsized to the targeted $150m, while pricing again settled at the lowest end of reduced guidance. These notes launched with coupon guidance of 5.75% to 6.5%, which was reduced to 5.25% to 5.75%, but now has settled at the lowest end at 5.25%, we’re told.The final tranche, of Class 4 notes which also have a four-year term, hit their $170m upsize target. This tranche launched with price guidance of 4% to 4.75%, which was reduced to 3.5% to 4%, and has now settled at 3.5% at the lowest end.The Class 2 notes, which are riskiest, have a base expected loss of 5.55%, which with a 7.75% coupon equivalent to be paid to investors implies a multiple of 1.4 times EL.The Class 3 notes have a base expected loss of 2.91%, so with a coupons of 5.25% these notes will offer investors a multiple of 1.8 times EL.Finally, the Class 4 notes, which are least risky and have a base expected loss of 1.53% and the coupon of 3.5%, will pay investors a multiple of 2.3 times EL.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2016-1) issuance.The transaction would cover Zenkyoren until October 2021, so a five-year layer of reinsurance containing within it three, three-year aggregate risk periods which overlap each other.Artemis understands from investor sources that Zenkyoren, the Japanese National Mutual Insurance Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives to give its full name, is seeking to sponsor the issuance of two tranches of notes through its Nakama Re Ltd. special purpose reinsurance vehicle.Proceeds from the sale of the two Series 2016-1 tranches issued by Nakama Re would be used to collateralise reinsurance agreements to provide protection to Zenkyoren for losses caused by earthquakes hitting Japan. The coverage will also include earthquake induced tsunami, fire, flood and sprinkler related water damage, we’re told.)A $200m Class 1 tranche and a $50m Class 2 tranche of cat bond notes are currently slated to be issued by Nakama Re, with both exposed to earthquakes and providing protection on a three-year aggregate and indemnity trigger basis.The Class 1 tranche would cover losses from JPY 2.15 trillion and cover losses up to JPY 2.5 trillion, while the Class 2 notes would cover a riskier layer, attaching at JPY 1.2 trillion and covering losses to JPY 1.5 trillion. Both tranches have JPY 270 billion franchise deductible.The less risky $200m of Class 1 notes have an annualised expected loss of 0.49% and are being offered to investors with coupon price guidance of 2.2% to 2.5%, while the Class 2 have an annualised expected loss of 1.47% and price guidance of 3.25% to 3.5%, we’re told.Update 1:Investor demand has been high, as the $200m Class 1 tranche of Nakama Re 2016-1 notes has now more than doubled to $550m in size, while the $50m Class 2 tranche of cat bond notes has tripled in size to $150m.Further demonstrating ILS and catastrophe bond investor demand, as well as strong execution by the deal team, both of the tranches of notes look set to price at the bottom end of initial guidance, also reflecting ILS investors increasing comfort with these three-year aggregate type cat bonds.The lower risk now $550m of Class 1 notes, which have an annualised expected loss of 0.49%, are set to price at the lowest end of initial guidance at 2.2% we’re told, which would offer investors a multiple of almost 4.5 times the expected loss.Meanwhile the riskier $150m of Class 2 Nakama Re 2016-1 cat bond notes, which have an annualised expected loss of 1.47%, are set to price at 3.25% which is also the lowest end of guidance, offering investors a multiple of 2.2 times the expected loss.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The protection is set to run for almost three years, across three risk periods, we’re told.The Market Re 2016-5 issuance involves a $30m tranche of Class A notes and a $40m tranche of Class B notes, with both tranches exposed to the risks of warmer winter temperatures across five key weather measurement points in the continent. The five locations where temperatures will be measured are London, UK; Paris, France; De Bilt, Netherlands; Prague, Czech Republic and Frankfurt, Germany.Weather data will be collected from these weather stations and used to construct an index, against which the transaction can be triggered and the size of any payouts calculated. As such the notes feature what could be termed either a parametric or weather-index trigger, with both tranches providing aggregate coverage per pre-defined calculation period.The two tranches will sit on top of each other but will provide cascading protection, with one dropping down to replace the other as it is eroded by aggregate losses, we are told. Essentially the notes will only be on risk during the winter months, as they are designed to provide reinsurance cover for exposure to warmer winter temperatures.We’re told that the $30m of Market Re 2016-5 Class A notes are the least risky, and this is reflected in price guidance of 4.5% to 6% for the tranche. Meanwhile, the Class B notes that sit beneath are being offered with price guidance of 13% to 15%, reflecting a higher level of risk.Update 1:Jardine Lloyd Thompson Capital Markets (JLTCM) ILS structuring and issuance team has successfully closed the ground-breaking temperature-linked weather catastrophe bond Market Re Ltd. (Series 2016-5), securing $30.75m of coverage against European winter temperature extremes for the sponsor.>The transaction downsized during its marketing phase, as one tranche was dropped, but what’s most important about this transaction is that it completed and could open up the cat bond market to greater securitisation of weather risks.The completed privately placed catastrophe bond, Market 2016-5 provides $30.75 million of single year parametric-based collateralized retrocession coverage for warm-weather winters across Europe in one tranche of notes.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

This is the second issuance under the Blue Halo Re vehicle in about a month.In this second Blue Halo Re issuance, the vehicle will seek to issue a single tranche of Series 2016-2 Class C cat bond notes which has a preliminary size of $100m.The Blue Halo Re 2016-2 notes will provide Allianz Risk Transfer with a three-year source of fully collateralised retrocessional reinsurance protection against industry losses caused by U.S. named storms (so tropical storms, hurricanes and any storm that has been named by the NHC) across all U.S. storm exposed states, including Florida, the Gulf Coast and east coast, as well as U.S. earthquake risks in all states.The Blue Halo Re 2016-2 cat bond notes will feature a state-weighted industry loss index trigger, with PCS providing the loss reporting and the reinsurance protection for this second Blue Halo Re is afforded on an annual aggregate basis.That’s one key difference to the 2016-1 issue just over a month ago. Blue Halo Re 2016-1 was a term aggregate cat bond, so the aggregation of losses ran across the term of the deal, where as this new 2016-2 cat bond aggregates on an annual basis.A number of cat bond investors we discussed the original Blue Halo Re cat bond with had queried the term aggregate nature and had expressed a preference for transactions that aggregate over annual risk periods instead of the deal-term.We understand that these notes are less risky than the two tranches issued in June through the $185m Blue Halo Re Ltd. (Series 2016-1) transaction, with the attachment point of this Class C tranche of notes attaching at an industry loss index value of 1.7bn and covering losses up to an exhaustion point at 1.85bn, with a franchise deductible per qualifying loss of 25m.That means the Blue Halo Re Series 2016-2 Class C notes are the least risky issued so far, but will continue the coverage further up the tower for Allianz Risk Transfer, sitting above the two tranches sold in the previous issuance.The Series 2016-2 Class C notes have an attachment probability of 4.28% at the base case, or 4.82% at the WSST sensitivity case, and an expected loss of 3.99% base and 4.49% sensitivity.The notes are being offered to investors with coupon price guidance of 8% to 8.75%, we understand, which would result in a base multiple of over 2x’s, even at the low-end of guidance and a sensitivity case multiple of 1.8x’s at the lower end of price guidance.Unsurprisingly the multiples look like they will be higher than the previous two Series 2016-1 tranches offered, as is typical when the coupon comes down.Update 1:The Blue Halo Re 2016-2 Class C notes have grown by 125% to $225m in size, but at the same time the price guidance on the notes has dropped to below the mid-point of where the cat bond launched, a definite reflection of the opportunity sponsors may find in the cat bond market right now.The Blue Halo Re Series 2016-2 Class C notes will be the least risky sponsored by Allianz ART so far, with an expected loss of 3.99% base and 4.49% sensitivity. The notes were launched with price guidance offered in a range from 8% to 8.75%.Now, we understand that spread pricing for the Blue Halo Re 2016-2 notes dropped to 8.25% before orders closed for this cat bond deal. At that pricing level the notes will offer investors a multiple of 2.07 times the base expected loss, or 1.83 times the WSST sensitivity case EL.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The transaction will have a three-year term, providing Allianz ART with coverage to June 2019.Blue Halo Re will issue a Series 2016-1 Class A tranche of notes, which is currently sized at $100m, and is the least risky tranche of this deal. The Class A notes will, we understand, attach at an industry loss index value of 1.3bn, covering up to 1.7bn with a franchise deductible of 25m. The Class A attachment probability is 8.65% and expected loss 7.24% at the base case or 8.56% WSST.The Class B tranche of notes to be issued by Blue Halo Re, sized at $50m, are more risky, attaching at an index level of 750m and exhausting at 1.3m, again with a 25m deductible. These notes have an attachment probability of 15.14%, and an expected loss of 11.53% base and 13.19% WSST.We’re told that the Class A notes are being offered to investors with coupon price guidance of 13% to 14%, which implies a multiple of 1.9 times the base case expected loss or 1.6 times the WSST EL, at the mid-point of spread guidance.Meanwhile the Class B notes are being offered with coupon guidance of 18% to 20%, we understand, which would result in a multiple of 1.6 times the base EL, or 1.4 times the WSST EL, again at the middle of price guidance.Update 1:During marketing, investor demand has helped Allianz ART to increase the size of the cat bond by 23%, so it now looks set to reach $185m in size. At the same time the price guidance on the two tranches of notes being issued has moved towards the upper-end of initial guidance.The Blue Halo Re Series 2016-1 Class A notes began life as a $100m tranche, but that has now been increased to $130m, we understand. At the same time the price guidance, which at launch was 13% to 14%, has now been moved to the top-end at 14%.Meanwhile, the Class B tranche of notes which are riskier, were launched at $50m in size and have now grown to $55m. This tranche was initially offered to investors with coupon guidance of 18% to 20%, but that guidance has now been fixed near the upper-end at 19.75%.At the new price guidance the multiples paid to investors are more in-line with the recent issuance seen in the catastrophe bond market.The $130m of Class A notes, with an expected loss of 7.24% at the base case or 8.56% WSST, would pay investors 1.9 times EL at the base case, or 1.6 times the WSST, at the revised price guidance. The $55m of Class B notes, with an expected loss of 11.53% base and 13.19% WSST, would pay investors 1.7 times EL at the base case, or 1.5 times the WSST, using the revised upwards coupon.Update after 2017 hurricanes:The $55 million of Class B notes are threatened by losses from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria of 2017, with the notes priced down in the secondary market for as much as a 70% loss of principal.Update December 2018:We understand that the $55m of Class B notes have now begun to make some principal repayments to the sponsor, as losses have allowed it to make reinsurance recoveries under the terms of the notes.Update June 2019:The $130 million Class A tranche of notes have had their maturity extended by one month, which is likely to allow for the Class B notes to realise a recovery and mature, or for fresh loss estimates to emerge.Update July 2019:It’s become apparent that the Class A notes are now threatened by losses and have had their maturity extended by another month. This tranche remains priced at around 97 in the secondary market, so the threat to them does not seem severe at this time.The Class B tranche, meanwhile, has now seen its $55 million of principal reduced by just over $40 million, as loss payments and reinsurance recoveries have continued for the sponsor.The Class B tranche also now has its maturity extended, to allow for any further development and further reductions in the remaining almost $15 million of principal.Update October 2019:Principal reductions have continued for the Class B tranche of notes with now $43.1 million paid out, leaving only $11.9 million of principal outstanding for this tranche.Update December 2019:The Class B tranche of notes from the Blue Halo Re 2016-1 cat bond has again had its principal reduced, with the amount left outstanding falling again to $10.868 million, while this tranche of notes are still marked down as facing a roughly 50% loss on broker pricing sheets.Both the $130 million Class A tranche of notes and the remaining $10.868 million of Class B notes have now had their maturity dates extended to June 22nd 2022.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The U.S. earthquake cover is for a more limited group of states, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, North & South Carolina and New Jersey, sources said.The Laetere Re Ltd. cat bond features on an indemnity trigger and will provide cascading per-occurrence protection, so as any loss events erode the reinsurance tower covering the three ceding insurers, the three tranches of Series 2016-1 cat bond notes come into play.A $30m Class A tranche of notes has an attachment probability of 3.08%, an exhaustion probability of 1.69% and an expected loss of 2.28%.A $40m Class B tranche of notes has an attachment probability of 7.55%, an exhaustion probability of 3.08% and an expected loss of 4.97%.Finally, a $30m Class C tranche has an attachment probability of 15.12%, an exhaustion probability of 7.55% and an expected loss of 11.25%.We’re told that the transaction is being structured more like a reinsurance contract, in how it pays its coupon, so discounted with the ceding insurer paying the premium upfront into the trust account to make up the principal.Effectively, this means investors earn their coupon up front, by paying discounted principal for the notes and therefore pricing is offered as a discount to face value.Hence the Class A, which are the least risky, notes are offered with price guidance of 93.25% – 94%, but that is what investors will pay upfront in terms of principal. So the coupon or premium for the one-year deal can be thought of as 6% to 6.75% for the Class A tranche.Class B, the mid-risk tranche, have price guidance of 89.5% to 90.5%, we’re told, which again translates to a one-year premium or coupon of 9.5% to 10.5%.Finally, the most risky tranche of Class C notes come with price guidance of 82% to 83%, effectively a high 17% to 18% premium or coupon, on a discounted basis.Update 1:Pricing has now been set for the three tranches of cat bond notes that Laetere Re Ltd. is issuing, with two tranches moving to the lower end of guidance while the third and riskiest saw pricing settle at the mid-point of the marketed range.The $30m Class A tranche of notes, which are the least risky, launched with price guidance of 93.25% – 94% (what investors would pay upfront in terms of principal). We’re told that this has been fixed now at the upper end of that range, so the coupon or premium for the one-year deal can be thought of as 6% for the Class A notes, so coupon pricing has effectively been reduced.The $40m Class B tranche, the mid-risk notes, launched with guidance of 89.5% to 90.5%, and pricing has now been fixed at the 90.5% level, suggesting a drop in coupon pricing during marketing and fixing it at a discount of 9.5% of principal.Finally, the most risky tranche of Class C notes launched with guidance of 82% to 83%, effectively a high 17% to 18% premium or coupon, and this has now been fixed at the middle of guidance, at 82.5%, so a 17.5% coupon on a discounted basis.So pricing or premium of this layer of capital markets backed reinsurance has become more attractive for United, during the deals marketing.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

It underwrites homeowners, rental and condominium insurance and has also participated in the Florida Citizens depopulation program.For this catastrophe bond recently registered Bermuda special purpose insurer First Coast Re Ltd. will seek to issue and sell to investors a single tranche of Series 2016-1 Class A notes, which have a preliminary size of $100m.The notes will collateralise a retrocessional reinsurance agreement with Swiss Re, while Swiss Re will enter into a reinsurance agreement with Security First Insurance so passing on the capital markets coverage to the insurer.The First Coast Re 2016-1 cat bond notes will cover losses from Florida named storms and severe thunderstorms. The coverage is for Swiss Re, but is ultimately based on the indemnity experience of Security First, we understand.The First Coast Re Class A notes provide their protection on a per-occurrence basis, using an indemnity trigger based on Security First’s loss experience, providing reinsurance across a three-year term.The First Coast Re 2016-1 cat bond notes will sit at the top of Security First Insurance’s reinsurance tower, but we’re told they feature a top and drop structure, so as catastrophe losses affected the insurers reinsurance provisions the cat bond attachment would drop down to replace any eroded reinsurance layers.So, given the top and drop structure of this First Coast Re cat bond, it effectively means the notes have an attachment point that will change after the insurer is hit by catastrophe events, even if those events do not hit the cat bond itself.The single tranche of Series 2016-1 Class A notes that will be issued by First Coast Re Ltd. initially cover a layer of risk in Security First’s reinsurance tower above $1.112 billion of losses, but are said to attach at $5m for the first two events, $2m of the next two and $0 for subsequent events. But those figures really represent retention on the covered layer reducing as it drops down, it appears.The notes have an attachment probability of 1.2% and an expected loss of 1.15%. We understand that they are being offered to ILS investors with price guidance of 4.25% to 4.75%, which would reflect a reasonably high multiple of at least 3.7 times the base expected loss. The high multiple likely reflects the top and drop structure, as the attachment probability will effectively be higher as the cat bond notes dropped down.Update 1:The target size for this First Coast Re cat bond has been reduced from $100m to $75m, the spread guidance for the single tranche of Class A notes has also been reduced to below the initial guidance range.When the cat bond transaction launched to investors it was offering the notes with coupon price guidance of 4.25% to 4.75%, but this has now been lowered and narrowed to 4% to 4.25%, which with the 1.15% expected loss still suggests a multiple of 3.5 times or above.That’s still a higher multiple than many cat bonds with comparable spreads, which is likely due to the top and drop nature of the protection which enables these cat bond notes to drop down Security First’s protection tower as losses erode its lower layers of reinsurance protection.The size of the First Coast Re cat bond is likely to be driven by Security First’s overall reinsurance purchase for the upcoming renewal, hence the reduction shouldn’t be considered an inability to place the notes but more likely a reflection of where the most effective pricing can be found.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Operational Re Ltd.","Operational Re Ltd.","Zurich Insurance Co. Ltd.","Credit Suisse is sole structuring agent and bookrunner","Milliman Inc","Operational risks","$222m","Indemnity","?","May 2016","Global investment banking group Credit Suisse has been testing the investment market (both ILS and traditional fixed income we understand) appetite for an ILS transaction which would ultimately provide the capacity to back an insurance policy covering the banks operational risk exposures.The offering would, if successful, provide a fully-collateralised source of insurance and reinsurance protection which would back a CHF700m (approx $687m) operational risk insurance policy provided by insurer Zurich, with Zurich retaining 10% of the risk and the remaining CHF630m (approx $620m) ceded to the deal’s investors.Credit Suisse turned to the ILS market and fixed income capital markets when it found that traditional reinsurance capacity could not be found to back the transaction.Credit Suisse is targeting a completion of this Operational Re Ltd. ILS issuance by March and wants to enter into the insurance agreement with Zurich that month.Credit Suisse is still seeking a five-year term for the insurance protection provided by Zurich and ultimately underwritten using the capital raised via the sale of ILS notes from Operational Re and the transaction remains structured on an annual aggregate and indemnity trigger basis.As the issuer, Operational Re Ltd. will sell its notes to investors in order to collateralise a reinsurance agreement between itself and ceding insurer Zurich. That quota-share reinsurance agreement will see Operational Re taking 90% of the CHF700m insurance policy risks to be collateralised with the investor capital, leaving Zurich with the other 10%, hence the CHF630m of notes available.To all intents and purposes Operational Re Ltd. is a catastrophe bond issuing vehicle, just covering a new type of risk. It’s a clear sign that the structure can be leveraged for a wider range of risks than the market currently features, and the fact this issuance is progressing is encouraging for the sector.The bond would be triggered when Credit Suisse suffered over CHF 3.5 billion of losses under the operational risk insurance agreement in any annual risk period (the attachment point), with an exhaustion point set at CHF 4.2 billion.Sources said the deal is cleverly structured such that it cannot be triggered by a single loss event, and so requiring a build up of operational risk impacts to the investment bank before investors could lose any principal.If the operational risk ILS is successfully brought to market it will be a first, perhaps paving the way for repeat transactions from other issuers. It would be another demonstration of the broadening of the ILS market and that the ILS and cat bond structure is eminently suitable for a wider range of risks than are currently transferred in the ILS market.We’re told investors would receive a 4% of notional coupon for their investment and that the notes, if issued, would have an expected loss of 0.15%. That makes the operational risk ILS deal fairly remote in terms of risk, but the key will be in helping investors to understand that.Update 1:The CHF630m operational risk insurance linked catastrophe bond or ILS structure Operational Re Ltd. is still being marketed by global investment banking group Credit Suisse, with April now being targeted for completion and the structure split into junior and senior tranches.A two tranche structure enables investors to select where to allocate capital, on a risk and return appetite basis, with the junior offering a higher coupon than the senior.A junior tranche will cover the first CHF300m of losses suffered by the Operational Re ILS, while the senior will cover the remaining CHF330m, but only attaching after the junior tranche has been exhausted, we understand. So in order for both tranches of the Operational Re ILS bond to suffer total losses Credit Suisse would have to suffer an aggregated operational risk indemnity of at least CHF4.2 billion. However, it’s important to note that no single operational risk loss could cause a loss to the notes, as the per-event limit is said to be CHF3 billion.That means for the Operational Re ILS notes to suffer exposure to event there would have to be an aggregation during one of the annual risk periods.We understand the two tranches of notes are now being offered with coupon guidance, with the junior tranche coming with guidance of 5.5%, while the senior coupon is said to be 4%.The covered insurance policy has a relatively remote risk, with the expected loss said to be just 0.15%. With the ILS only taking a 90% share of losses in the policy that means the coupons on offer should prove attractive to investors, both the more traditional type and the ILS investors with an interest in this deal.We understand that Milliman Inc. has been appointed as a risk modelling and calculation agent for this transaction.We’re told that the investors that will back this transaction are varied, ranging from some specialist ILS investment managers, to hedge funds focused on regulatory capital opportunities, to insurance companies, family offices and also some of the world’s larger fixed income bond investment companies.Update 2 (May 4th 2016):The new special purpose insurer (SPI) named Operational Re Ltd. has now been registered in Bermuda for this transaction.The notes will provide cover for some cyber risk exposures, such as IT system failure that causes business interruption, fraudulent behaviour both of external parties and employees of the investment bank, fiduciary issues, losses due to improper business practices or unauthorised activity, accounting errors, documentation errors, regulatory compliance issues, HR issues, discrimination in the workplace or even personal injury.It’s a wide-ranging insurance cover but the way the Operational Re transaction is structured, to prevent a loss to noteholders from a single operational risk event or category alone ensures that for any payout to be made by the notes Credit Suisse would have to suffer a major impact to its business, just the scenario that ILS structures and risk capital are best placed to provide protection.The junior tranche an expected loss of just 0.15%, while the senior tranche has an expected loss of 0.2%, both very low in the world of catastrophe bonds and ILS.Based on Credit Suisse’s internal operational risk model it appears that the probability of the Operational Re notes facing a full loss of both tranches is about 1-in-1200, which is very remote. Based on an analysis of historical operational risk losses suffered by Credit Suisse, no losses would have occurred to the Operational Re notes from 2001 to 2014, reflecting just how unusual a loss event would need to be.It’s said that the riskier junior tranche of notes has been fully subscribed, largely by regulatory capital hedge funds, and sources said it is expected that the senior tranche will also be subscribed and the deal is expected to launch in May now.Issuance of Operational Re Ltd. has taken time because Credit Suisse needed to generate investor support for what is a new type of risk, build an investor base and also as the timing needs to be close to its results, we understand.Update 3 (May 17th 2016):We’re told that the latest terms for the transaction show a targeted size of CHF270m for the overall operational risk insurance protection, with Zurich still expected to retain CHF70m and the Operational Re Ltd. special purpose insurer set to issue CHF200m of notes to provide the fully collateralised reinsurance protection.While Zurich’s retention will remain the same size, the percentage of the insurance policy to be retained by the insurer is of course increasing quite significantly.The transaction remains split into two tranches, with a riskier junior tranche sized at CHF110m and a senior tranche at CHF90m, we understand.Credit Suisse will itself continue to retain an operational risk loss of CHF3.5 billion, with that effectively the attachment point, but the other terms of the Operational Re operational risk cat bond all remain the same, we’re told.So the underlying insurance policy and the reinsurance from the Operational Re ILS notes will still provide Credit Suisse with annual aggregate protection against certain operational risk losses. With specific limits still in place to ensure that no single operational risk loss event, or category of loss, can trigger these notes on its own. So this is effectively a second and subsequent loss event ILS deal.We’re told that the pricing has also been adjusted on one of the tranches of notes to be issued by Operational Re Ltd.The riskier junior tranche of Operational Re notes will continue to offer investors the 5.5% coupon we wrote about recently here. But the senior tranche has had the coupon raised slightly, to 4.5% from the previous 4%.Update 4 (May 26th 2016):Investment bank Credit Suisse’s Operational Re Ltd. transaction, which uses a catastrophe bond structure to secure insurance via the capital markets for operational risk exposures, has now been successfully settled at CHF 220m in size (around $223m).A number of factors changed as the deal made its final progress to market, with investors requirements resulting in the issuance of a third tranche of notes and the risk retention held by insurer Zurich reducing down to just CHF50m, Artemis understands.Artemis has now seen the final terms and pricing agreed for the Operational Re transaction, which show that Credit Suisse increased the size of the deal slightly from the CHF200m it had shrunk to ten days ago, to complete it at CHF220m (US$222 million).So, as we understand it from the details seen, the investment bank now has in place a CHF270m operational risk insurance policy from insurer Zurich, effective today, with Operational Re providing CHF220m of the capital via a reinsurance arrangement between itself and the insurer, collateralised by the sale of the three tranches of notes to investors.The insurance arrangement underlying the Operational Re notes runs from today for just over five years, to the end of May 2021, Artemis understands, providing Credit Suisse with a mostly collateralised source of operational risk cover for the duration of this term.Credit Suisse continues to retain CHF3.5 billion of operational risk losses before the insurance would kick in (so the attachment point) and we understand that it still cannot be triggered by a single operational risk event, with the coverage on an annual aggregate basis.Before close, the transaction changed slightly, in terms of the number of tranches of notes issued by Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurer Operational Re Ltd.We understand that a CHF105m Class A-1 tranche, a CHF5m Class A-2 tranche both pay investors a 4.5% coupon, with the A-2 tranche a Reg S issuance in larger denomination notes, so likely to meet a specific investors needs. Meanwhile the riskier junior tranche remained a CHF110m Class B set of notes that was also issued, and will pay investors a 5.5% coupon.So it looks like the operational risk insurance coverage that Credit Suisse will receive through the transaction will be just over 80% provided by the reinsurance sourced through the capital markets and this insurance-linked securities (ILS) transaction, with investors in Operational Re on the hook for CHF220m of qualifying losses while Zurich retains CHF50m of the risk.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The notes are being offered to investors with spread guidance in a range from 5.75% to 6.25%, we’re told.So that would result in a multiple paid to investors of 2.2 times the expected loss at the mid-point of price guidance, a multiple that drops to just over 2 times the expected loss at the warm sea-surface temperature (WSST) scenario expected loss of 2.9%.Update 1:Reinsurance firm Munich Re’s Queen Street XII Re dac 2016 catastrophe bond transaction could as much as double in size, with the company raising its target to $150m to $200m for the bond, while at the same time price guidance has been lowered.The deal is now being marketed with a target size of $150m to $200m, we’re told, suggesting Munich Re will at least double the coverage that the just matured Queen Street VII Re Ltd cat bond transaction (for which this is a near replacement) provided.In fact, if Queen Street XII Re 2016 hits the upper end of the target range, at $200m, it will actually be the largest catastrophe bond Munich Re has ever been the primary sponsor of, according to the 400+ cat bonds listed since 1997 in our Deal Directory.The single tranche of notes to be issued launched with coupon guidance of 5.75% to 6.25%, but that range has now been reduced to 5.25% to 5.75% sources said, suggesting that the pricing will be at or below the initial expectations for Munich Re.With the notes having an initial 2.71% expected loss, that suggests a multiple of 2.1 times at the top end of revised pricing, or lower, which would be a multiple of 1.8 times at the WSST EL of 2.9%.Update 2:The Queen Street XII cat bond is now set to complete at $190m, providing Munich Re with its largest source of cat bond investor backed retrocessional reinsurance ever.At the same time as upsizing to $190m the pricing has now been fixed at the lower end of a reduced range, at 5.25%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The notes will have a four-year term.A $50m Class 10 tranche of notes are set to be the riskiest, attaching at $910m and covering a percentage of USAA’s losses up to $1.202 billion. These notes have an initial attachment probability of 12.03% and an expected loss of 7.58%. The coupon spread for this tranche is marketed as a range of 11.75% to 12.75%.Next, a $50m Class 11 tranche of notes would attach at $1.202 billion of losses and exhaust at $1.918 billion, resulting in an attachment probability of 4.61% and an expected loss of 2.13%. This tranche is being offered to investors with price guidance of 5.25% to 6%.Finally, a $50m Class 13 tranche has an attachment point at $1.918 billion, covering losses to an exhaustion point at $2.638 billion. This tranche has an attachment probability of 0.98% and an expected loss of 0.62% and offer investors a coupon in the range of 3.75% to 4.25%.So this Residential Re 2016-1 cat bond offers ILS investors a range of risk and return options, from the much more risky Class 10 notes, which have a base multiple of 1.6 times expected loss at the mid-point of guidance. To the mid-risk Class 11, which have a multiple of 2.6 times at the mid-point of guidance. Or the much lower risk, but perhaps higher return per unit of risk, Class 13 notes which have a much higher multiple of 6.5 times expected loss at the mid-point of coupon guidance.With the selection of risk and return levels, as well as the broad layers that each tranche will cover, USAA has plenty of scope to increase the size of this cat bond, if it should choose to hand over more of its reinsurance program to the capital markets and ILS investors.The attachment point is comparable with some existing USAA cat bonds, allowing us to compare the potential pricing to a degree and giving another snapshot of how cat bond pricing has declined in-line with the overall reinsurance market.The 2016-1 Class 10 notes attach at the same level as USAA’s Residential Re 2014-1 Class 10 notes, which paid investors a coupon of 15%.The 2016-1 Class 11 notes attach at the same level as the Residential Re 2013-1 and 2015-1 Class 11 notes, which paid investors coupons of 8% and 6% respectively.Finally the 2016-1 Class 13 notes attach at the same level as the Residential Re 2014-1 Class 13 notes, which paid investors a coupon of 3.5%.So again, it’s clear that pricing will be more attractive than the similar deals for the two riskier tranches, for the Class 10 and 11 notes. Of course it’s important to note the expansion of the covered perils, suggesting even greater value for USAA from this its latest cat bond deal.However, the lowest risk Class 13 notes in this Residential Re 2016-1 cat bond issuance could actually end up paying a higher coupon than the 2014-1 deal, reflecting investors demand for minimum returns on bonds with lower yields.Update 1:The tranches are now proposed as $50m to $75m for the riskiest Class 10 and mid-risk Class 11 notes, while the lowest risk tranche of Class 13 notes are now proposed as between $50m to $150m in size.At the same time as the proposed upsize, all three tranches of notes have seen their price guidance reduced down to levels below the lowest end of initial guidance with the ranges tightened, again suggesting enough investors have received the transaction and its peril expansion positively.The riskier Class 10 notes, which launched with price guidance of 11.75% to 12.75%, are now offered with guidance of 11.5% to 11.75%. The mid-risk Class 11 notes, which launched at 5.25% to 6%, are now offered at 4.75% to 5.25%. Finally, the lower risk Class 13 notes, which launched at 3.75% to 4.25%, are now offered with price guidance of 3.25% to 3.75%.Update 2:The lowest risk Class 13 tranche of notes have been given a ‘BB-(sf)’ rating by Standard & Poor’s.Update 3: We understand that USAA is set to achieve its upsized target of $250m for this Residential Re 2016-1 cat bond issuance, an increase of 67% in terms of reinsurance capacity secured. At the same time the expectation is that pricing will settle today at the lowest end of the already reduced guidance, as the ILS investor market once again supports USAA’s risk transfer needs.The Class 10 tranche of notes, which is the riskiest, is expected to be $65m in size. This tranche launched with price guidance of 11.75% to 12.75%, which was subsequently reduced to 11.5% to 11.75% and is now expected to price at the low-end of that reduced guidance at 11.5%. That is a multiple of 1.51 times the 7.58% expected loss.The Class 11 tranche of notes are expected to hit $75m, which are the mid-risk of the three, launched with pricing guidance of 5.25% to 6%, which was reduced to 4.75% to 5.25% and is now set to price at 4.75%. With an expected loss of 2.13% these notes offer investors a multiple of 2.23 times.Finally, the Class 13 lowest risk tranche of notes are anticipated to reach $110m in size, which launched with coupon guidance of 3.75% to 4.25%, which was then reduced to 3.25% to 3.75%, are expected to price at 3.25%. With the 0.62% expected loss these notes will offer a multiple of 5.24 times.Update, March 23rd 2018: USAA’s aggregated losses from catastrophe events in the current risk period have now reached roughly $1 billion, suggesting that these 2016-1 Class 10 notes are triggered and if the estimates remain unchanged investors will face some losses. With some months left until the end of the risk period and the next reset, there is the potential for noteholders of this tranche to face a growing loss of principal.Update June 4th 2019:It appears that a reinsurance recovery may have been made under the Residential Re 2016-1 cat bond.The Residential Re 2016-1 Class 10 notes tranche has had its principal reduced from the issued $65 million to $21,467,693, a roughly two-thirds reduction in the amount of notes left outstanding.The maturity date for these notes is June 6th 2020, so still a year to run and be on-risk for.The Residential Re 2016-1 Class 10 notes were marked down for bids as low as 7 in secondary broker pricing sheets, which suggested that investors expect this catastrophe bond to face more losses and an almost total loss of principal.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Back in January the California Earthquake Authority (CEA) used the platform to transform a collateralised reinsurance signing on its renewal, with the $57m Resilience Re Ltd. (Series 15121A).Now a larger, second transaction has come to light, with the listing of an $85m Resilience Re Ltd. (Series 1642B) tranche of notes on the Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX).The $85m of notes issued by Resilience Re Ltd. are discounted zero coupon participating notes, which suggests that again this is the transformation of a collateralised reinsurance deal with the coupon having been paid as premium and the notes created to provide an investor (or investors) with liquid securitised access to the underwritten risk.The $85m of notes have a due date of April 7th 2017, so represent a single annual reinsurance contract, it would seem. It’s safe to assume that these notes are exposed to property catastrophe reinsurance risks, but of what type we do not currently know.It is highly likely that this transaction is designed to cover an April reinsurance renewal cedent. It is possible that this latest Resilience Re private cat bond is for the CEA’s reinsurance program, as the organisation had another renewal due at the start of April, however we cannot confirm that at this stage.With the listing on the BSX, the investors in this $85m Resilience Re Ltd.

We also understand that State Farm sought to encourage those that participated in the cat bond to also participate in its traditional renewal.State Farm’s Merna Re IV Ltd. cat bond, issued in March 2013, matures on the 8th April this year, hence this Merna Re 2016-1 cat bond is understood to be a straight renewal for that transaction.The covered perils ceded to ILS investors through this Merna Re 2016 cat bond are U.S. earthquake risks, covering the New Madrid fault region in the mid-west, the same peril covered by the maturing 2013 cat bond deal.It’s also safe to make the assumption that this Merna Re 2016-1 is an indemnity transaction, given State Farm’s other cat bonds in recent years have all provided the insurer with a source of indemnity reinsurance protection.We’re told that this deal priced at 2.25%, 25 basis points below the maturing 2014 Merna Re deal, however we cannot confirm that 100%.

(Series 2014-1) (which matures in 2017) and also a longer term, as this new cat bond will be a four-year protection.The Aozora Re 2016-1 cat bond will provide SJNK and subsidiaries with a source of fully-collateralised reinsurance protection over the four-year term for losses from typhoons affecting Japan. The reinsurance protection will be on a per-occurrence basis and the cat bond features an indemnity trigger, we understand.The notes are slightly riskier than the existing Aozora Re 2014 cat bond, attaching at JPY 480 billion (approximately $4.26 billion) and exhausting at JPY 580 billion (approximately $5.15 billion). Those figures result in a modelled attachment probability of 1.07%, we understand, which is higher than the 0.57% initial attachment probability of the 2014 cat bond.The single tranche of Series 2016-1 Class A notes to be issued by Aozora Re, preliminarily sized at $175m, have an initial expected loss of 0.9%. We’re told the notes are being offered to investors with coupon price guidance in a range of 2.2% to 2.7%, so suggesting a multiple of around 2.75 times the EL at the mid-point of pricing.We understand that the subject business includes personal, commercial and industrial Japanese fire insurance policies, which is where typhoon risks and related flooding are covered in Japan. Only losses due to typhoon winds and flood are covered, we believe, meaning that typhoon induced rainfall appears covered under the flood component.Update 1:According to sources SJNK is set to succeed at upsizing the coverage it gets from ILS investors, with this Aozora Re 2016-1 cat bond set to grow by over 25% to provide it with $220m of per-occurrence fully-collateralised reinsurance protection on an indemnity basis.As well as growing the coverage it will receive from this cat bond, SJNK looks set to benefit from keen pricing and the appetite for diversifying risks, with the price guidance dropping right to the low-end of the initial guidance.When the Aozora Re 2016-1 cat bond was launched the single tranche of notes were being marketed with coupon guidance of 2.2% to 2.7%.We’re told that at the latest deal update the price guidance has been reduced to the lower end at 2.2%, which with the notes having an initial expected loss of 0.9% would result in a multiple of 2.44 times.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The $130m Akibare II cat bond matures at the end of March 2016, so this new deal will replace and potentially upsize that coverage.People familiar with the deal said that Mitsui Sumitomo is seeking a new four-year source of collateralised reinsurance protection for its Japanese typhoon exposures. Akibare Re Ltd. will issue a single Class A tranche of notes, which is said to be $175m in size.The notes will provide Mitsui Sumitomo with annual aggregate reinsurance protection on an indemnity trigger basis for losses from Japanese typhoons impacting the country and which cause a loss above a JPY 5 billion franchise deductible across the four-year term, we understand.The notes will attach at JPY 300 billion of losses and cover a layer up to JPY 340 billion, giving them an attachment probability of 1.36% and an expected loss of 1.19%. The notes are said to be being marketed to investors and ILS managers with price guidance of 2.5% to 3%, we’re told, giving a multiple of 2.3 times the expected loss at the mid-point of that range.Update 1:The Akibare 2016-1 catastrophe bond upsized by almost 15% to $200 million during marketing.At launch the Class A notes came with price guidance of 2.5% to 3%. Demonstrating the attraction of diversifying perils and their ability to drive down prices, even at lower risk/return levels, we understand that pricing was adjusted today to the lower end of that guidance range, at a coupon of 2.5%.With the now $200 million tranche of Akibare Re 2016-1 notes having an expected loss of 1.19%, the new pricing level would see investors receive a multiple of 2.1 times the expected loss. That’s aligned with the multiple of other remote risk cat bond diversifiers in the Japanese region, particularly from such large and established insurance group sponsors.Update, Feb 2019:The Akibare Re 2016-1 catastrophe bond is considered at-risk of loss due to Mitsui Sumitomo’s rising ultimate losses from Japanese typhoons that struck in 2018, largely typhoon Jebi but possibly also including some impacts from typhoons Trami and Prapiroon.The secondary market is pricing the notes for a roughly 30% loss, bids of around 70 cents on the dollar, which suggests the market sentiment is for a loss of principal of around $60 million currently.Update, Apr 2019:Ongoing loss creep from Japanese typhoon events has driven Mitsui Sumitomo’s ultimate losses higher, resulting in the Akibare Re 2016-1 catastrophe bond notes being marked down even further.The notes are now marked down to as low as 20 cents on the dollar on some broker pricing sheets, suggesting a roughly 80% loss of principal from the $200 million tranche of notes, which could equate to as much as $160 million.Update, May 2019:It’s now expected that the $200 million of Akibare Re 2016-1 cat bond notes will be marked down to close to zero on broker pricing sheets today, to reflect the new expectation that this will be a total loss of principal for the investors and funds holding this cat bond.Continued loss creep has driven Mitsui Sumitomo’s loss estimates higher and according to specialist cat bond and ILS investment fund manager Plenum Investments the aggregate loss from across four Japanese storms in 2018 has now risen to JPY 367 billion, which is actually above the exhaustion point for the notes that was set at JPY 360 billion.So that suggests a 100% loss of principal for holders of the Akibare Re 2016-1 catastrophe bond is almost guaranteed.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Last year’s Manatee Re cat bond was Florida wind only, as Safepoint has been expanding its business scope and now requires broader coverage.The Manatee Re 2016-1 cat bond will provide its named storm reinsurance protection across a three-year term, to March 2019, with protection on a per-occurrence basis and using an indemnity trigger.Safepoint is seeking protection across a number of layers of its reinsurance program with this Manatee Re 2016-1 cat bond, with the three tranches all having differing attachment points.The Class A tranche, which has a preliminary size of $50m, attaches at $30m of losses above Safepoint’s FHCF participation reinsurance cover, and covers a $200m layer. That effectively means a $306m attachment point and $506m exhaustion point, we’re told.The Class A tranche has an attachment probability of 1.92% and an expected loss of 0.98% at the base case. These notes are being marketed with price guidance of 4.75% to 5.5%.The $30m Class B tranche sits alongside the FHCF reinsurance layer, so attaching at around $65m and providing pro-rate coverage up to $300m of losses in Safepoint’s tower. It’s possible that this tranche will enable Safepoint to reduce its use of FHCF coverage, as we’ve seen other Florida insurers do.The Class B notes have an attachment probability of 7.61% and an expected loss of 3.05% at the base case, so much more risky than Class A. These notes are being offered to investors with coupon guidance of 7% to 7.75%.Finally a $20m Class C tranche is even more risky, attaching at $30m of losses and covering a $35m layer up to $65m. As a result the attachment probability for Class C is high at 14.28%, while the base expected loss is 10.32%. This tranche is being marketed with pricing guidance of 15.25% to 16.25%, we’re told.Update 1:The tranche B class of catastrophe bond notes which were being offered as part of Safepoint Insurance Company’s latest cat bond deal Manatee Re Ltd. (Series 2016-1) were pulled from the offering.The Class B tranche were designed to sit alongside the insurers Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (FHCF) reinsurance layer, perhaps designed to help it reduce its reliance on the FHCF. It’s not clear whether that had any bearing on this tranche being pulled from the offering or whether it is simply a case of investor feedback being most positive on the Class A and C tranches.Update 2:The Class A tranche of notes, which began life with a preliminary size of $50m and price guidance of 4.75% to 5.5%, which was subsequently revised upwards to 5% to 5.5%, has now been priced at an upsized $75m with pricing fixed at 5.25%, we understand.Meanwhile the much higher risk Class C tranche has not increased in size, remaining at the $20m since launch. However the pricing on this risky layer, one of the riskiest to hit the cat bond market in some time, has been set at the top-end of initial guidance in response to investor demand for a coupon commensurate with the risk.The Class C notes were launched with price guidance of 15.25% to 16.25%, which was subsequently narrowed towards the top-end at 16% to 16.25%. At final pricing this $20m tranche has been fixed at 16.25%, based on investor feedback and demand we’re told.So Safepoint has secured $95m of capital markets-backed reinsurance protection for some of its Florida and Louisiana named storm risks.Update September 22nd 2017:Sponsor Safepoint Insurance Company expects to collect on the riskiest $20 million Class C tranche of notes after its claims from hurricane Irma look set to eat through that layer of reinsurance protection.Sources told Artemis that an event notice has been filed on behalf of Safepoint Insurance Company, the sponsor of the Manatee Re Ltd. (Series 2016-1) catastrophe bond, revealing the initial estimate of the insurers hurricane Irma losses that qualify under the terms of the cat bond and the level reported suggests a loss for the bonds holders.We’re told that the event notice discloses a $100 million initial estimate of Safepoint’s hurricane Irma losses (that are relevant and qualify under the cat bond terms), which is sufficient to eat through the highest risk Class C tranche of Manatee Re 2016-1 cat bond notes.Update March 29th 2019:The Manatee Re 2016-1 cat bond was allowed to mature, which will have enabled sponsor Safepoint Insurance to collect on the reinsurance recovery it was due from the $20 million Class C notes that were impacted by losses from hurricane Irma in September 2017.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

SDDCO Brokerage Advisors LLC is sole placement agent (bookrunner).","AIR Worldwide","U.S. tropical cyclones, earthquakes, severe thunderstorm, winter storm, wildfire, volcanic eruption, meteorite impact, other perils","$50m","Indemnity","NR","Mar 2016","U.S. military mutual insurer USAA has returned to the catastrophe bond market with a new issuance vehicle and different approach, as it seeks a source of broad multi-year and peril reinsurance protection from the capital markets through an Espada Reinsurance Limited (Series 2016-1) transaction.Espada Reinsurance Limited is a recently registered Cayman Islands domiciles special purpose vehicle established for the issuance of catastrophe bonds by USAA.With this Espada Re 2016-1 cat bond USAA is seeking between $50m and $100m of collateralized reinsurance protection. The issuance will provide multi-year cover over a risk period running for four years from June 2016 to June 2020, we understand.Espada Re 2016-1 will provide USAA with reinsurance protection across the U.S. for the perils of U.S. tropical cyclones, earthquakes, severe thunderstorm, winter storm, wildfire, volcanic eruption, meteorite impact.These are the same perils covered by recent Residential Re cat bonds. However for Espada Re USAA has also added a classification of “other perils” which are defined as naturally occurring events that are identified as catastrophes by reporting agency PCS.This is very interesting as it means a successful Espada Re cat bond would cover flooding risks, storm surge, rainfall events, avalanche and more. It effectively guarantees USAA coverage for any natural catastrophe or weather event that could cause it a major loss. Espada Re could perhaps include coverage for such rare events as a major fire caused by lightning strike (a natural event). The “other peril” classification does not include man-made loss events however, we’re told.The coverage provided is, as you might expect given the broader peril definition, on an annual aggregate basis and the transaction will utilise an indemnity trigger.The Espada Re 2016-1 Class 20 tranche of notes that are being issued, while only between $50m and $100m in size, will provide coverage across a broad layer of USAA’s reinsurance program of around $1.5 billion from an attachment point modelled at just under a billion up to an exhaustion point around $2.5 billion.That means the coverage is on a percentage pro-rata basis across that full range of losses, which with the notes being aggregate could suggest that USAA is testing the waters for a much more meaningful use of the capital markets across its reinsurance program in future.As a result of the wide layer that is covered the Espada Re 2016-1 Class 20 catastrophe bond notes will have slightly unusual metrics, with an attachment probability that is quite high at 8.33%, while the expected loss remains lower at 1.93%, sources said. This reflects the greater probability of a loss occurring, while the loss is likely to be smaller due to the way the protection is spread pro-rate across the reinsurance layer.We understand that the notes are being marketed to ILS investors with coupon price guidance of 5.25% to 5.75%, so offering a multiple that is inline with the market average at this coupon level.Espada Re 2016-1 is being structured by Rewire Holdings LLC and we understand that the firms web-based marketplace, Rewireconnect, is being used to market the notes. SDDCO Brokerage Advisors, LLC is said to be acting as placement agent (or bookrunner) for this transaction.Update 1:The Espada Re cat bond only secured $50m of reinsurance protection for USAA and investors pushed the coupon to settle at the top-end of guidance, at 5.75%.Update Jan 2019:The Espada Re catastrophe bond has been added to those considered at risk of loss after USAA’s qualifying losses from catastrophe events in 2017 and 2018 rose to a level where it is assumed this cat bond could be triggered. The notes are currently marked down only around 10% to 20%, suggesting an up to $10 million loss of principal may be expected.Update June 4th 2019:It appears USAA may have made a reinsurance recovery under the Espada Re cat bond notes.The Espada Reinsurance cat bond transaction has seen its principal reduced from the $50 million of notes issued to $47,794,184, a roughly 4.5% reduction in the amount of notes left outstanding.The maturity date for the Espada Re cat bond is still June 6th 2020, so it remains in-force and on-risk for another year.The Espada Re cat bond notes were marked down for bids as low as 80 in broker’s secondary market pricing sheets, suggesting the market anticipated a roughly 20% loss of principal for this deal.Update June 2020:USAA received a further reinsurance recovery loss payment of almost $2.97 million from Espada Re, so the remaining principal was reduced further to $44,823,653 in June 2020.The company also returned roughly $35m to investors from this transaction, leaving $9,823,653 outstanding.Update May 26th 2021:USAA received another loss payment under the Espada Re cat bond notes of $716,734, which reduced its outstanding to $9,264,853.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The term of the cover is slated to begin on 1st March 2016.The Class A notes feature an attachment point of $1.915 billion and cover a layer of losses up to $2.252 billion. The layer covered is $337m in size, leaving room for the tranche to grow from the initial $225m size mooted.This equates to an attachment probability of 1.82%, an exhaustion probability of 1.43% and an expected loss of 1.58%. The Caelus Re IV 2016-1 Class A notes are being marketed with price guidance of 5.5% to 6.25%, we’re told.That is a high multiple, likely reflecting the broader range of subject business that this catastrophe bond will cover. At the base case the multiple of expected loss to coupon would be 3.5x even at the lower end of price guidance. At the sensitivity case expected loss, which is 1.94%, the multiple is reduced to 2.8x, still higher than the average (again at the lower end of the coupon range).Given the broader coverage being sought, which is similar to some of AIG’s Tradewynd cat bonds we understand, it will be interesting to see how the ILS investor community supports the deal and where the pricing settles. Cedents are looking for broader cover from the cat bond market, so transactions like this are a good test of appetite.Update 1:The Caelus Re IV 2016-1 cat bond looks set to upsize to $300m, while the pricing dropped to the low-end of guidance.he price guidance fell right to the bottom of the guidance range, to settle at 5.5%, which with the expected loss of 1.58% at the base case would provide a multiple of expected loss to coupon of 3.5x. At the sensitivity case expected loss, which is 1.94%, the multiple is reduced to 2.8x.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The acquisition has yet to complete and we understand that if it failed to then Zephyr would no longer be a cedent for this deal, with the coverage just applying to Heritage P&C.This will be Heritage’s fourth catastrophe bond under the Citrus Re vehicle (details of each can be found in our Deal Directory). This transaction sees the insurer once again looking for a flexible source of fully-collateralized reinsurance protection from the capital markets in a layer of its program alongside its FHCF participation.We’re told that this cat bond deal will see Citrus Re Ltd. issuing two tranches of Series 2016-1 notes, a (currently) $150m Class D-50 tranche and a $100m Class E-50 tranche, to collateralize an underlying reinsurance agreement with the ceding insurers.Protection from both tranches will be on a per-occurrence basis and the notes feature an indemnity trigger. The protection will run across three U.S. hurricane seasons, we understand, from June 2016 to a maturity date in February 2019, so in total around two years and eight months.Coverage is initially for losses suffered by either of Heritage P&C or Zephyr from named storms affecting Florida and Hawaii. However, as with other Citrus Re cat bonds from Heritage the covered area can be updated to include other hurricane exposed U.S. states, reflecting Heritage’s desire to expand and grow into other states of the U.S., something it is already doing.The $150m Class D-50 tranche of notes attach at $360m of losses and coverage exhausts at $960m, however we understand that these notes inure to a layer of private reinsurance that provides $400m of cover above $360m of losses. That effectively makes these notes cover a percentage of a $600m layer attaching at $760m of losses, we believe.The riskier $100m Class E-50 tranche cover a percentage of losses from $360m to $760m in the Heritage reinsurance program, so sit beneath the Class D-50 notes.Class D-50 has an attachment probability of 4.19%, an expected loss of 3.01% and are being marketed to ILS investors with coupon guidance of 7% to 7.5%, we understand. Class E-50 has an attachment probability of 8.11%, an expected loss of 5.75% and are being marketed with price guidance of 10% to 10.5%.So no surprise to see a higher multiple for the lower risk notes (2.4 times the EL at the base case and mid-point of pricing), with the higher risk/return tranche offering a multiple of 1.8 times the expected loss at the mid-point of pricing.Update 1:The Citrus Re 2016-1 cat bond does not look like it will upsize, being set to secure the $250m of fully-collateralized reinsurance cover Heritage was looking for from the off, however the pricing for each of the two tranches issued has been set at the top-end of initial guidance.At the latest update, sources said that the tranche sizes have remained the same, with the $150m Class D-50 tranche and $100m Class E-50 tranche remaining static at pricing.However both tranches priced at the top-end of pricing, as once again ILS investors sought to ensure a certain multiple of return from their investments in the cat bond.The Class D-50 notes, which have an expected loss of 3.01%, were marketed to ILS investors with coupon guidance of 7% to 7.5%, but priced at the top-end of that range at 7.5%, we’re told. In terms of multiple that’s 2.5 times the expected loss.The riskier Class E-50 notes, which have an expected loss of 5.75%, were offered with price guidance of 10% to 10.5% and priced again at the upper end of that range, at 10.5%. As a multiple these notes offer 1.8 times the base expected loss.Update, November 1st 2017:Heritage’s catastrophe bonds look set to take some losses due to the impacts of hurricane Irma.Heritage announced a $388 million gross loss from the impact of hurricane Irma, which looks high enough to eat into the bottom of its catastrophe bond protection within its reinsurance tower.Sitting lowest down in the tower are the Citrus Re 2016-1 Class E-50 notes, which after reset attach at $330 million of losses to the sponsor.Based on the notes covering 30% of a layer of Heritage’s reinsurance program, it looks as if this E-50 tranche could see around a 17% loss of principal, based on the latest loss estimate, which would equate to a loss to noteholders of roughly $17 million.Update, February 27th 2018: Heritage’s exposure to hurricane Irma has become a little clearer, after the insurer notified investors of its estimated amounts it can claim under this catastrophe bond.Heritage currently hopes to claim back $49 million of the $100 million tranche of Citrus Re 2016-1 Class E-50 notes.Update, March 20th 2019:The $150 million Citrus Re Ltd. Series 2016-1 Class D-50 tranche of cat bond notes which attached for Heritage at around $568 million of losses, have had their maturity extended by two more years out to February 25th 2021 to allow for further development of losses (likely related to hurricane Irma).Update on losses/redemptions:For the latest details on potential losses for this bond please view our directory of catastrophe bond losses and cat bonds considered at-risk.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The coverage provided is indemnity protection for Aetna’s losses above a pre-defined medical benefit ratio trigger for each tranche and the notes are both structured on an annual aggregate basis.The transaction will have a four-year term, covering losses suffered from January 2016 to the end of 2019, with the medical benefit ratio calculated on an annual basis to see whether Aetna’s claims have breached the trigger point and whether any payout is deserved.The $140 million Class A tranche of notes to be issued by Vitality Re II will attach at a medical benefit ratio of 100% up to exhaustion at 114%. As ever the Vitality Re II notes are very remote risk, with an attachment probability of 0.03% and an expected loss of less than 0.01%. These notes are offered with price guidance of 1.5% to 2.15%, we’re told.The $60 million Class B tranche of Vitality Re II 2016-1 notes are a little riskier, attaching at a medical benefit ratio of 94% and exhausting at 100%, so sitting beneath the Class A tranche of notes. This tranche has an attachment probability equivalent to 0.47% and an expected loss of 0.18%, so again very remote risk. This tranche is being marketed with price guidance of 2% to 2.65%.For either tranche of notes to face a payout, the medical benefit ratio must breach the trigger attachment points within one of the annual risk periods.These two tranches have a similar risk profile to the Vitality Re VI Ltd.

All three tranches will provide protection for each of the covered perils on an annual aggregate and industry loss trigger basis. The transaction will run for three annual risk periods to the end of 2018.U.S. named storm, U.S. earthquake and Canadian earthquake coverage will be triggered based on a PCS weighted industry loss index, while European windstorm protection will use a PERILS AG weighted industry loss index. Coverage for all perils is for the typical states and countries where exposure is highest to each peril, we understand.The three tranches of notes sit on top of each other, to ultimately provide coverage across a layer that attaches at $200 million of losses up to an exhaustion of coverage at $800 million of losses. All three tranches feature a $40 million per event deductible, we’re told.A $100 million Class A tranche of notes is the riskiest, attaching at $200 million and exhausting at $400 million. A $100 million Class B tranche then attaches at $400 million and runs up to exhaustion at $600 million. Finally, A $100 million Class C tranche attaches at $600 million and exhausts at $800 million.Of course that structure would give XL the opportunity to upsize the transaction significantly, if it found market conditions conducive and wanted to, to cover the entire $600 million layer of its program through the capital markets with this cat bond.Given how low the Class A tranche attaches it has a high probability of attachment, initially at 12.74%, with an expected loss of 8.66% at the base case or 9.52% at the WSST sensitivity case. This tranche is being marketed with price guidance of 13.75% to 14.25% we’re told.The Class B tranche has an initial attachment probability of 5.9%, with an expected loss of 4.57% base or 4.96% sensitivity. This tranche will offer a coupon in the range of 9.25% to 9.75%.Finally the Class C notes have an initial attachment probability of 3.55%, so the least risky, with an expected loss of 2.85% base or 3.09% sensitivity. This tranche is marketed with pricing of 7.25% to 7.75%.In terms of multiples, at the middle of these guide ranges, the Class A tranche would provide 1.62 times the expected loss at the base case, or 1.47 times at the sensitivity case. That’s a low multiple and it will be interesting to see where pricing goes, as it will provide a good indicator of investor risk appetite for higher-yielding cat bond notes.Class B would offer a base case multiple of 2.08 times the expected loss, or 1.92 times the sensitivity case. Class C would offer a base multiple of 2.54 times the expected loss, or 2.43 times the sensitivity EL.Update 1:In a clear demonstration of investor appetite for higher-yielding catastrophe bond notes, the price guidance for all three tranches has been adjusted, with each now offered to investors with narrowed guidance below the low-end of the initial launch range.The riskiest Class A tranche launched with price guidance of 13.75% to 14.25%, but this has been narrowed and lowered to 13.5% to 13.75%, we understand.The middle risk Class B tranche launched offering investors a coupon in the range of 9.25% to 9.75%, but this has dropped to 9% to 9.25%.Finally, the lowest risk tranche of Class C notes, which were marketed with pricing of 7.25% to 7.75%, have had their pricing guidance adjusted downwards as well to 7% to 7.25%.Update 2:The pricing for the Galileo Re 2016-1 catastrophe bond settled at the low-end of the reduced guidance range.The $100m Class A notes priced at 13.5%, the bottom of the reduced range and so offer investors a multiple of 1.56 times the base case EL, or 1.42 times the sensitivity case.The $100m Class B tranche of notes again priced at the low-end of reduced guidance at 9%. That results in a multiple of 1.97 times the base EL, or 1.81 times the sensitivity case.The lowest risk $100m Class C tranche of notes priced at the low-end again, at 7%.

The hurricane expected loss is 1.2% and the Australian cyclone 1.51%, suggesting that cyclones in Australia are the bigger threat to the cat bond notes.The as yet unsized tranche of notes are being offered to investors with coupon guidance of 5.75% to 6.5%, we understand.At the bottom end of guidance the multiple would be 2.16 times the base expected loss. At the upper end 2.43 times. Using the sensitivity case those figures drop to 2.01 and 2.27 times the EL.We understand that this, Munich Re’s 12th issuance through a vehicle named Queen Street, is its first to use an Ireland domiciles ‘designated activity company’, hence the ‘dac’ after the deal name. Previous Queen Street’s have used an Irish special purpose insurance vehicle.The 2014 Companies Act or Ireland changed the rules regarding limited companies and the new designated activity company. DAC’s are limited by activity through their clause, constitution and articles of association, making them the new Irish vehicle suitable for use as a cat bond SPV.Update 1:The deal size was set at $100m of retrocessional protection for Munich Re.At the same time the initial coupon guidance has been fixed at a level of 6.15%, just slightly above the mid-point of the launch guidance of 5.75% to 6.5% (6.125%).With the expected loss for this cat bond initially set at 2.68%, that pricing at 6.15% will reflect a multiple of 2.29 times the EL paid to the investors, in line with recent issuance.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The notes can be triggered by an extreme mortality event that raises a mortality index above predefined trigger points. The mortality index will be weighted by age and gender.Investors in these notes will be at risk of an increase in age and gender-weighted mortality rates exceeding a specified percentage of the predefined index in the covered areas.In order for the mortality index triggers for each covered area to be breached, the index must breach a trigger level of 120% for Australia, 115% for Canada and 120% for the UK, we’re told.In terms of probabilities, the Vita Capital VI 2015-1 notes have a probability of attachment of 1.24%, a probability of exhaustion of 0.81% and an expected loss of 0.99%.The notes are being offered to investors with coupon price guidance of 2.75% to 3.25%, which even at the lower end of guidance would equate to a multiple of at least 2.78 times the EL.We understand that the notes feature a dropdown facility for year five, which would reduce the mortality index trigger level. This may be a way to make the coverage more valuable in the last year of its term. Swiss Re has redeemed previous Vita mortality cat bonds before the end of their lives due to the fact that pandemic coverage becomes reduced at that stage (more on this here).We understand that these Vita Capital VI mortality insurance-linked notes will cover all mortality events, including deaths caused by terrorism events. However, the main threats and contributors to expected loss to such mortality cat bond notes remains pandemic diseases and outbreaks of severe influenza.Update 1:The Vita Capital VI 2015 mortality cat bond remained at $100m in size.However the pricing moved slightly below the mid-point of the 2.75% to 3.25% initial guidance, resulting in a coupon of 2.9%.With the notes expected loss of 0.99% and the 2.9% coupon, the multiple investors will benefit from is 2.93 times the expected loss. So, while the pricing declined slightly from the middle of guidance, the multiple to be paid to investors is above average for 2015’s cat bond deals.Update April 2020:Given the threat posed by the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic, S&P placed its ‘BB (sf)’ rating on the Class A notes issued by Vita Capital VI Ltd. on CreditWatch with negative implications.“The notes could be at risk of triggering if the COVID-19 pandemic leads to a significant increase in deaths in either the U.K., Canada, or Australia,” S&P explained.Adding, “The risk period ends on Dec. 31, 2020. We currently believe that there is such significant uncertainty around the total number of deaths caused by the pandemic in any of the three countries that it is difficult to determine the likelihood of a rating action at this stage.”Update July 2020:S&P removed the notes from negative watch and affirmed their rating again, as the UK death rate no longer looks sufficiently high to impact these notes or trigger any extension or default of it.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2015-1)","Zenkyoren","Aon Securities is sole structuring agent and bookrunner","AIR Worldwide","Japan earthquake","$300m","Indemnity","NR","Dec 2015","For this cat bond, we understand that Zenkyoren’s Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurance vehicle Nakama Re Ltd. will issue two tranches of Series 2015-1 notes to cat bond investors, to collateralize two reinsurance agreements between itself and Zenkyoren.Both tranches of notes will be exposed to losses from earthquakes in Japan, covering damage and losses caused by shaking, tidal wave, fire following, flood and sprinklers, across Japan and its islands. The cat bond will feature an indemnity trigger for both tranches.Nakame Re Ltd. will issue a Class 1 tranche of notes, which has a preliminary size of $100 million and will provide Zenkyoren with per-occurrence reinsurance protection across five risk periods over a five-year term.A Class 2 tranche of notes, also sized at $100 million currently, is structured to provide its protection on a three-year aggregate basis, across each of three overlapping risk periods, over a five-year term in total.The tranches are similar in structure to Zenkyoren’s last catastrophe bond, Nakama Re Ltd. (Series 2014-2), except in that deal the per-occurrence tranche covered a four-year term, so this deal sees Zenkyoren looking for five years of reinsurance protection from each tranche.We’re told the Series 2015-1 Class 1 tranche of per-occurrence notes to be issued by Nakama Re will have an initial attachment probability of 1.31% and an expected loss of 1.16%. The notes will attach at JPY 1.4 trillion and cover losses up to JPY 1.6 trillion. This $100 million tranche are being offered to investors with coupon guidance of 2.75% to 2.875%.The $100 million Series 2015-1 Class 2 tranche of notes are the three-year aggregate tranche and have an attachment probability of 2.81% across the first three-year risk period, 0.94% on a yearly basis. This tranche has an initial expected loss of 2.59% over a three-year period, 0.86% annually. Losses will be covered from JPY 1.7 trillion up to JPY 1.85 trillion, after a franchise deductible of JPY 270 billion. This tranche is being marketed with price guidance of 2.875% to 3.25%.The attachment levels of both tranches in this cat bond are lower than the 2014-2 Nakama Re issuance, making it more risky, but still these are remote risks which would only be triggered by very major earthquake events striking Japan, at which point you’d expect significant impact to insurance, reinsurance and cat bonds anyway.The price guidance looks relatively aligned with the 2014-2 transaction as well, with multiples in the range of that cat bond from last December.Update 1:This cat bond upsized by 50% to $300m while marketing, thanks to investor demand.The Class 1 tranche remains at $100 million in size, sources told Artemis, but the pricing has moved to the top end of initial guidance at the same time. This tranche launched with coupon guidance of 2.75% to 2.875%. It is now being offered at the top-end at 2.875%.Meanwhile the Nakama Re 2015-1 Class 2 tranche of notes has doubled in size, to $200 million. The pricing on these notes has also hardened and moved to the top of the initial range, which was 2.875% to 3.25%, to now offer investors a coupon at 3.25%.The Class 1 tranche, with pricing likely at a coupon of 2.875%, will now provide a multiple of 2.48 times the initial expected loss of 1.16% to investors. The Class 2 tranche, if it prices at the 3.25% coupon, would provide investors a multiple of 3.78 times the annualised expected loss of 0.86%. Investors are clearly being compensated for the multi-year aggregate structure of this tranche, which could go some way to explaining the upsizing.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

We understand the tropical cyclone cover includes flood coverage for rental policies. The covered area includes the District of Columbia and all 50 U.S. states.The notes would be triggered by a per-occurrence indemnity loss of above $1.493 billion, the attachment point, covering a percentage of losses suffered up to the exhaustion point at $2.23 billion. The initial attachment probability is 4.75%, with an initial expected loss of 3.26%.Both those factors can flex depending on variable reset terms that USAA may choose to take, meaning these notes can get riskier, or indeed less risky, with investors being compensated depending on the level of expected loss. We’re told the expected loss can be reset from as low as 2.76% to as high as 3.76%.The Series 2015-2 Class 3 notes are to be marketed to ILS investors with initial coupon guidance of 7% to 7.75%. At the 3.26% initial expected loss that would be a multiple of 2.15 times the EL at the lower end of guidance, or 2.38 times the EL at the upper end of price guidance. Of course if you look at the warm sea surface temperature sensitivity case figures the multiples decline somewhat.The nearest comparisons in USAA’s long cat bond issuance history are two Class 3 tranches of notes from 2012 and 2013. Both attach at similar levels and have similar expected loss measurements, but the Residential Reinsurance 2012 Ltd. (Series 2012-2) Class 3 notes paid investors a coupon of 12.75%, while the Residential Reinsurance 2013 Ltd. (Series 2013-1) Class 3 notes paid a coupon of 9.25%.Once again that demonstrates the rate decline in catastrophe bond coupons over the last few years, however it’s also important to note that neither of those deals included volcanic eruption or meteorite impact risks, which while very small contributors to expected loss are there in the more recent deals all the same.Rating agency Standard & Poor’s said that it has assigned a ‘B-(sf)’ preliminary rating to the Series
2015-II Class 3 notes to be issued by Residential Reinsurance 2015 Ltd.Interestingly, S&P put some detail behind the way it assesses non-modelled, or less well-modelled risks in cat bonds such as this, explaining that the “effect from tropical cyclones in nonmodeled states, wildfire, volcanic eruption, and meteorite impact has a de minimus effect.”From the S&P pre-sale report:The AIR model for hurricane does not include the following states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Nevada, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. AIR does not have models to analyze the risks from wildfire other than in California, and it does not have models for volcanic eruption or meteorite impact.When determining the nat-cat risk factor, we believe the effect from tropical cyclones in nonmodeled states, wildfire, volcanic eruption, and meteorite impact has a de minimus effect. The largest current estimate of ultimate loss in nonmodeled states from a hurricane since 2003 is $1.1 million. For wildfire, the losses experienced by the ceding insurer for any single event outside of California did not exceed $80 million. Because this is a per-occurrence trigger, we do not consider wildfire a major contributor to the nat-cat risk factor.There are approximately 165 volcanoes in the 50 states and approximately 120 of them are in Alaska and Hawaii. The Property Claims Service loss amount for the 1980 Mt. St Helens eruption was $27 million.We considered a report from the U.S. Geological Survey that indicates volcanic activity may trigger earthquakes, and the less-well-understood relationship between earthquakes and volcanoes. Typically, the resulting event is of a smaller magnitude.We were given information in the East Lane Re VI transaction that the 1908 meteor impact in Siberia was a 1-in-1,000-year event. The Barrington Crater in Arizona was formed by a meteor impact approximately 50,000 years ago. In February 2013, a large asteroid exploded above the Russian city of Chelyabinsk. The object’s air burst injured approximately 1,500 people and damaged more than 7,200 buildings valued in excess of $30 million. According to our sources, this is the largest known object to have entered the Earth’s atmosphere since the 1908 Tunguska event.In March 2015, we rated East Lane Re VI Ltd Series 2015-I notes, which covered losses from volcanic eruption and meteorite impact. Our total adjustment to the nat-cat risk factor was 2 basis points; we applied the same amount for this issuance.S&P also explained on the risk modelling of prior historical events:Based on AIR’s analysis, on a historical basis since 1900, there has been one event–the 1938 unnamed hurricane that made landfall in New York and Rhode Island–that would have triggered the notes. The modeled principal reduction is 44%. The next three historical events that generated the highest modeled losses were 1926’s Great Miami hurricane ($1.432 billion), 1954’s Hurricane Hazel ($1.407 billion), and 2005’s Hurricane Katrina ($1.101 billion). The 1926 and 1954 events were very close to the current attachment point.Based on AIR’s analysis, there have been three earthquakes since 1700 that would have triggered the notes. These (and the related modeled principal reductions) are the 1906 San Francisco quake (96%), the 1812 New Madrid sequence (52%), and the 1886 Charleston quake (21%). The next quake that generated the greatest modeled ultimate loss was the 1700 Cascadian subduction zone event. The modeled ultimate loss is $1.062 billion.The exposure in these notes is greatest from tropical cyclones, with Florida the greatest contributor, followed by severe thunderstorms and then earthquake.Update 1:According to sources, the price guidance range has been narrowed at the bottom end of guidance, to 7% to 7.25%, as the book builds and nears closing.With the notes having an initial expected loss of 3.26% at the base case the notes now look likely to pay investors a multiple of 2.15 times the EL at the low end of the tightened guidance, or 2.22 times EL at the new upper end of the range.The sensitivity case expected loss is 3.65%, which would give a multiple of 1.92 times the EL at the lower end or 1.97 times at the upper end of the new range.Update 2:The Residential Re 2015-2 catastrophe bond upsized by 25% to $125m in size before pricing.Update 3:The pricing was set at 7.25%, the upper end of the tightened range.The $125 million of Residential Re 2015-2 cat bond notes have an initial expected loss (EL) of 3.26% at the base case or 3.65% on a sensitivity case basis. With pricing now set at 7.25%, that results in a multiple of 2.22 times the base EL, or 1.97 times the EL for the WSST sensitivity case.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The notes issued, which will be in two tranches, will both have a four-year term and both provide cover across the U.S., Canada, District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.So Kilimanjaro Re 2015-1 comes out of the blocks at $300m in size, split into two tranches of notes, each of which are exposed to the same perils across the covered area. Both tranches of notes will provide per-occurrence reinsurance protection to Everest Re and both use a location-weighted industry loss trigger, based on data reported by Property Claim Services (PCS).The first tranche, a Kilimanjaro Re 2015-1 Class D tranche of notes, has a preliminary size of $125m. The Class D tranche has an initial index attachment point of $1.257 billion, covering a pro-rata share of losses up to an exhaustion point of $1.816 billion.The second, Class E tranche of notes has a preliminary size of $175m and are the less risky of the two, with an initial index attachment point of $1.841 billion covering up to exhaustion at $2.521 billion.The Class D notes have an initial attachment probability of 6.25%, we understand, with an initial expected loss of 4.71% (5.25% on a WSST sensitivity basis). This $125m tranche is being marketed to investors with price guidance of 9% to 9.75%, we’re told.The Class E tranche meanwhile have an initial attachment probability of 3.58% and an initial expected loss of 2.7% (3% on a WSST sensitivity basis). This $175m tranche is being marketed to the investor base with price guidance in a range of 6.5% to 7%.In terms of the multiple, or ratio of expected loss to potential pricing giving a view of the risk/return characteristics of the cat bond tranches, both are roughly aligned with recent issuance.The Class D tranche, with has a multiple at the mid-point of price guidance of 1.99x at the base case, or 1.79x at the sensitivity case. The Class E tranche has a multiple at the mid-point of price guidance of 2.5x at the base case and 2.25x at the sensitivity case.Update 1:The Kilimanjaro Re 2015-1 catastrophe bond more than doubled to $625m while marketing.The Class D tranche, which is the riskier of the two, grew to $300 million in size, while the Class E tranche has upsized to $325 million.As well as upsizing to $625 million in size, the price guidance for both tranches of Kilimanjaro Re 2015-1 notes was fixed.When the deal launched the Class D tranche had spread guidance of 9% to 9.75%, making it one of the highest coupon cat bond offerings for quite a while. We understand that the guidance has now been fixed at 9.25%, so towards the lower end and just below the mid-point of guidance.Conversely, the Class E tranche which is now the largest, and lower risk, looks set to price at the mid-point. This tranche launched with price guidance of 6.5% to 7%, but we understand that has been fixed at 6.75%.At 9.25% the Class D tranche of notes would pay ILS investors a multiple of 1.96 times the expected loss of 4.71%. The Class E tranche, at 6.75%, would pay investors a multiple of 2.5 times the expected loss of 2.7%.Update 2:The deal priced at the above levels, with the $300m Class D tranche offering a coupon of 9.25% and the $325m Class E tranche 6.75%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Passenger Railroad Insurance insures Amtrak, like a captive arrangement and also reinsures some of Amtrak and its partners insurance arrangements, we understand.PennUnion Re Ltd. is a Bermudian SPI established for the purpose of issuing catastrophe bond notes. In this deal PennUnion Re will seek to issue a single tranche of Series 2015-1 Class A notes which will be sold to ILS investors. We understand the cat bond deal is targeting a size of at least $200m.By selling the notes, PennUnion Re will be able to fully-collateralize a reinsurance agreement between itself and Passenger Railroad Insurance, which will in turn provide insurance protection to Amtrak.The coverage from the PennUnion Re 2015-1 cat bond will be on a per-occurrence basis, across just over a three-year period, providing protection against the perils of U.S. storm surge and wind from named storms, as well as earthquakes.Storm surge protection, which we understand to be the main driver of the cat bond expected loss, is for New York City and Delaware. Named storm wind protection is across Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Earthquake protection is for Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.All three perils feature parametric triggers, commonly used in corporate catastrophe bonds such as this where the beneficiary wants a source of insurance protection that pays out rapidly. The payout mechanics are designed to provide a sliding scale of payment for all three perils, with increasing payouts for increasingly severe events.We understand that the surge parametric trigger is based on calculation points at tidal stations, such as New York City’s The Battery and in Delaware City. The named storm wind parametric trigger uses the Weatherflow hurricane network recording stations as calculation points, which are located around the U.S. coastline. The earthquake peril’s trigger is based on shake data and information reported by the USGS.This cat bond transaction will provide a source of responsive insurance coverage for Amtrak, paying out in the event of a catastrophe above certain parameters of intensity impacting the region where the rail company operates and has the highest concentration of assets and infrastructure.The sliding scale mechanism ensures that payouts are linked to intensity of catastrophe events and the likely ensuing damage and interruption to Amtrak’s infrastructure and business. We expect to see more of these corporate sponsored parametric cat bond transactions, as they make perfect sense as a source of risk finance and transfer.We understand that the Series 2015-1 cat bond notes to be issued by PennUnion Re Ltd. will have an attachment probability of 2.68%, at the base case, with an exhaustion probability of 1.58% and an expected loss of 1.97%.The $200m of notes are being offered to investors with price guidance in a range of 4.5% to 5.25%, we’re told. Which would suggest a multiple ranging from 2.3 to 2.7 times the expected loss.We understand that in terms of historical events, superstorm Sandy would have caused a 100% loss to the cat bond notes. With the cat bonds exposure heavily weighted towards storm surge events, it’s clear that for Amtrack the key type of event it wants protection from is a repeat of such a storm and the resulting surge.Rating agency Standard & Poor’s has assigned a ‘BB-(sf)’ preliminary rating to the Series 2015-1 notes to be issued by PennUnion Re Ltd.S&P highlights that this is only the second cat bond in the market’s history to include storm surge as the primary driver of the risk being transferred to the capital markets.S&P also notes that being a parametric transaction, there is basis risk between the attachment levels and actual losses incurred. However, mitigating that fact is that the measuring stations are located in areas that S&P says are correlated to Amtrak’s modelled losses.It’s also worth noting that for Amtrak the cat bond is designed to provide insurance payouts in the event of catastrophes that it knows will have a serious impact on its business. Hence the basis risk is likely not a major issue for the sponsor.Update 1:Amtrak’s PennUnion Re Ltd. catastrophe bond was upsized during marketing by 38% to $275m.At the same time the pricing settled at the lowest end of guidance, at 4.5%, a drop of almost -8% from the mid-point of guidance.The Class A notes to be issued by PennUnion Re Ltd. have an initial expected loss of 1.97%, which means the coupon will provide investors a multiple of 2.28 times the EL at the base case. A sensitivity case multiple would be a little lower at 2.19x’s the sensitivity case EL of 2.05%.Also noteworthy is the fact that the issuance of this cat bond was delayed by hurricane Joaquin which threatened an east coast U.S. landfall, causing the cat bond to be held back by one week.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The target is to raise at least $150m of cover through the sale of the notes to ILS investors, to collateralize a reinsurance agreement between the SPI and the CEA.The Ursa Re 2015-1 cat bond will feature an indemnity trigger, with reinsurance protection afforded on an annual aggregate basis to the CEA. The transaction will have a three-year term, running until mid-September 2018.We’re told that the notes will cover losses on a $500m layer of the CEA’s reinsurance program, triggering at $2.581 billion of losses to the insurer and covering around 30% of the losses at the $150m tranche size. That leaves room for the CEA to upsize the deal if the market is conducive and investor appetite strong.The Class B tranche of notes have an initial attachment probability of 2.89%, we understand, with an expected loss of 2.62% and an exhaustion probability of 2.39%.The notes are being offered to investors with a coupon range of 4.75% to 5%, which at the 2.62% expected loss would result in a multiple of 1.81x at the lower end of the pricing range, 1.86x at the midpoint or 1.91x at the top end of price guidance.The Ursa Re 2015-1 cat bond features a variable reset, as so many catastrophe bonds now do. We understand that this would allow the CEA to move the layer of coverage from as low as a $1.861 billion trigger point, up to as high as $3.045 billion, providing flexibility for its future reinsurance needs over the term of the cat bond.The notes offered have a similar risk profile, in terms of attachment probability and expected loss, to the Class B notes issued by Ursa Re in 2014, which eventually priced at 5% which was the top end of guidance. It will be interesting to see how this 2015 deal prices by comparison.Swiss Re Capital Markets is acting as the sole structuring agent and bookrunner for the cat bond.

GC Securities are sole bookrunner.","RMS","Turkey earthquake","$100m","Parametric","NR","Aug 2015","For its second catastrophe bond the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool (TCIP, which is managed by Eureko Sigorta A.Ş., has registered a new special purpose reinsurance vehicle in Bermuda named Bosphorus Ltd.The TCIP’s current cat bond, the April 2013 Bosphorus Re Ltd. parametric Turkish earthquake cat bond matures on the 3rd May 2016, so a renewal had been widely expected in advance of that date.It had been rumoured that the TCIP was looking to make its second cat bond an indemnity trigger affair, but the lack of insurance adjusting expertise in Turkey, among other issues, likely made a parametric trigger the only option again (for the moment, as remember PCS now has a catastrophe loss data service and index in Turkey, so industry loss triggers will become a viable alternative).For this cat bond TCIP through its Bosphorus Ltd. vehicle is seeking a new source of fully-collateralized Turkish earthquake reinsurance protection over a three-year term, according to sources.Bosphorus Ltd. will issue and sell a single tranche of Series 2015-1 Class A cat bond notes to investors in order to collateralize an underlying reinsurance agreement between itself and the TCIP.At the moment the transaction is being launched with a suggested minimum size of $10om of notes, but there is a good chance that number will rise significantly as the Bosphorus 1 Re deal that matures next year provided $400m of cover and the TCIP will no doubt want to replace a good proportion of that, especially if market conditions are conducive.The Bosphorus 20151 cat bond features a parametric trigger, with the terms surrounding the trigger seemingly the same as the previous TCIP cat bond. Coverage is on a per-occurrence basis, as you’d expect with such a parametric cat bond deal.For an earthquake to qualify as a triggering event and cause a loss it must result in spectral acceleration (a gravity based measure of ground movement and shaking from earthquakes) above 0.1g for at least 10% of the defined measurement locations and be confirmed by the calculation agent, which is risk modeller RMS.As with the previous Bosphorus cat bond this new 2015-1 deal is focused on earthquakes affecting the Istanbul region of Turkey, where the highest concentrations of insured exposures lie for the TCIP.The initial attachment probability for the Bosphorus Ltd. Series 2015-1 notes is said to be 2.04%, the initial exhaustion probability is 1.09% and the initial expected loss 1.5%.Those figures are higher than the previous TCIP cat bond, suggesting that there is an increased exposure in the covered area or that the calculation approach to the parametric index differs slightly to cover a slightly more risky layer of TCIP’s reinsurance program needs.The calculation process features an index which is derived from the spectral acceleration and the number of calculation locations, applied to a factor to represent the exposure level.The $100m of Bosphorus 2015-1 Class A notes are being marketed to ILS investors with price guidance of 3.5% to 4%, we understand.Last year’s Bosphorus 1 Re cat bond had an initial expected loss of 1.01% and paid investors a 2.5% coupon, giving a multiple of 2.48 times the EL.This new Bosphorus 2015-1 cat bond, with its expected loss of 1.5% and coupon range of 3.5% to 4%, would offer investors a multiple of 2.33 at the lower end of price guidance, or 2.67 times at the upper end.We understand that there are historical earthquake events which when simulated with models could have caused a loss of principal to this cat bond, but none of these were within the last hundred years.Update 1:The Bosphorus Re 2015-1 cat bond is said to be set to complete at up to $200m in size.At the same time as upping the target for the bond, the price guidance dropped to below the original range and narrowed to 3.25% to 3.5%.With an initial expected loss of 1.5%, the Bosphorus 2015-1 cat bond looks set to complete offering investors a multiple of between 2.17 and 2.33 times EL.Update 2:The Bosphorus 2015-1 cat bond settled at just $100m in size, the lower end of the TCIP’s target.However the pricing settled at the low-end of the reduced guidance range, at 3.25%. That’s a multiple of just 2.17 times the initial expected loss of 1.5%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Bellemeade Re Ltd. (Series 2015-1)","Bellemeade Re Ltd. (Series 2015-1)","United Guaranty (AIG)","AIG and BNP Paribas were co-managers. Credit Suisse was structuring agent and sole bookrunner.","N/A","Mortgage insurance risks","$298.89","Indemnity","NR","Jul 2015","The Bellemeade Re Ltd. transaction, which listed on the Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX) on the 29th July, is essentially an ILS or capital markets based reinsurance securitization deal, not a mortgage loan securitization like those that gained such a tainted profile during the financial crisis.It is not securitizing mortgage loans or credit risk, as has been reported elsewhere in the financial press, rather it provides reinsurance protection to AIG subsidiary United Guaranty Corporation for the risk of seeing a dramatic increase in mortgage insurance payouts.The deal does mean that United Guaranty has transferred risks that are ultimately linked to the default rates on the mortgage loans it provides, of course, as the insurance policies pay out when a borrower defaults or cannot make a repayment.United Guaranty, ultimately the cedent or sponsor here, largely provides mortgage insurance to borrowers who do not have large deposits to put down on homes, hence some of the mortgage population in the U.S. that could be considered higher risk, or less prime.As a result, with a large portfolio of insurance policies that pay out when homeowners default on mortgage payments or miss payments and make a claim on their mortgage insurance, United Guaranty and AIG need reinsurance capacity for that exposure.Bellemeade Re Ltd. is a Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurance (SPI) vehicle that was registered in June, designed to facilitate a collateralized reinsurance transaction for United Guaranty and AIG, through the securitization of the risk and sale of notes to investors.Bellemeade Re entered into a reinsurance agreement with United Guaranty, which will see it assume the mortgage insurance loss risks associated with an insurance portfolio for mortgage loans amounting to around $32.4 billion.The reinsurance protection that Bellemeade Re provides to United Guaranty is on an aggregate basis.Bellemeade Re has issued and sold $298.89m of Series 2015-1 insurance-linked notes to investors, transferring the risk of mortgage insurance losses on to them and receiving collateralized reinsurance protection in return. The notes are said to cover a percentage of losses within layers of the mortgage insurance portfolio.It’s important to understand that it’s the risk of AIG subsidiary United Guaranty suffering mortgage insurance losses, above a specified attachment level, associated with these loans that is being reinsured and transferred, not the loans themselves or loan repayment risks.As the Bellemeade Re structure is a typical ILS, effectively the same as a property catastrophe bond, the Bellemeade Re notes feature a trigger. The deal has been structured as an indemnity bond, with three different payout levels and three tranches of notes issued.All three tranches of notes have a 10 year term, with a 5 year call option. Final maturity is scheduled for the 25th July 2025.This Series 2015-1 issuance from Bellemeade Re Ltd. involved the issuance of a $14.429m Class B-1 tranche, a $140.168m Class M-1 tranche and a $144.291m Class M-2 tranche of notes.In terms of pricing, the notes pay a spread above 1 month Libor. The Class B-1 notes are the riskier and pay 6.3%, Class M-1 pays 2.5%, making them the least risky and Class M-2 pay 4.3%.Investors are taking on the risk that United Guaranty suffers mortgage insurance losses above a certain level during each risk period. At this time we don’t have any details on the attachment levels or the probabilities of attachment and expected losses associated with the notes.So this is an indemnity reinsurance transaction, with any losses to be borne by the capital markets investors in the Bellemeade Re notes tied to the amount of mortgage insurance losses suffered.The notes will provide fully-collateralized reinsurance protection for United Guaranty’s mortgage insurance risks. The collateral will be held in trust, as with all ILS and cat bond deals.We understand that the Bellemeade Re notes were broadly marketed, but predominantly to investors who would understand mortgage insurance risk meaning that much of the ILS market may not have seen this deal.The Bellemeade Re Ltd. transaction was placed as a standard Rule 144a offering to a broad group of money managers and mortgage specialist hedge funds, we understand.The three tranches of notes have been collateralized with highly rated U.S. Treasury funds, we understand, as is typical of ILS transactions.We’re told that AIG itself and BNP Paribas acted as co-managers for this transaction, while Credit Suisse was the sole bookrunner.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Citigroup is joint bookrunner.","RMS","U.S. earthquake","$300m","Parametric","Fitch: 'BBsf'","Jul 2015","The Acorn Re 2015-1 catastrophe bond sees Hannover Re acting as ceding reinsurer in front of one named ceding insurer, Oak Tree Assurance Ltd., which is a Vermont domiciled captive insurance vehicle. The cat bond also seems to provide some protection for losses Hannover Re suffers from reinsurance agreements with other unnamed ceding insurance companies.Interestingly, from the information we can trace on the captive Oak Tree Assurance, it appears to be a workers compensation captive owned by the Kaiser Permanente group of health plan companies. So this U.S. west coast earthquake cat bond looks to be providing cover for the Kaiser workers compensation captive insured exposure to earthquake risks.Acorn Re Ltd. will issue a single tranche of Series 2015-1 Class A notes, with a current size of $200m, to provide the cedants with collateralized reinsurance protection against U.S. earthquakes located around the west coast.The coverage area is focused around California, Oregan, Washington, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Arizona, British Columbia in Canada, as well as Baja California, Baja California Sur and Sonora states in Mexico. The exposure we understand is most concentrated in California.It would seem the reason for B.C. and Mexican states being included is to cover earthquakes occurring around the region which could cause major damage in California. If this is indeed covering Kaiser Permanente then that would make sense as Kaiser’s operations are U.S. based.The coverage afforded by the notes will be on a parametric trigger and per-occurrence basis, across a three-year risk period.The parametric trigger specifies that qualifying earthquakes must occur within a 1 degree times 1 degree earthquake box within the overall covered area. The trigger has four levels of severity which can cause different levels of event percentage and loss.We understand that a repeat of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake could result in a 75% event percentage, according to the models used.As is important with parametric triggers for catastrophe bonds this one seems reasonably simple for investors to understand and model.Fitch Ratings explained more about the parametric trigger for this cat bond:The trigger is per occurrence based on a parametric ‘cat-in-a-box’ structure utilizing up to 430 predetermined Earthquake Box Locations which are each a square box of size one degree by one degree on the Earth’s surface (one degree latitude is approximately 69 miles; one degree of longitude gradually shrinks from the equator to the poles, and at 40, one degree is approximately 53 miles). The area that comprises the group of Earthquake Box Locations is delineated by latitudes 26 and 54 and longitudes -132 and -110.A Covered Event will have occurred if the Reporting Agency (initially the United States Geological Survey) reports an Earthquake during the Risk Period that has a location within one of the respective Earthquake Box Locations with a magnitude higher than the Minimum Magnitude of the box and with a Depth that is less than or equal to 50 kilometers.For each respective Earthquake Box Location, there is an established Minimum Magnitude for each progressive Trigger Level, which is used to determine the applicable Event Percentage should a Covered Event occur within. The Event Percentage is a step-function that corresponds to each Trigger Level: Trigger Level One – 25%, Trigger Level Two – 50%, Trigger Level Three – 75%, Trigger Level Four – 100%. Event Payments for the transaction are calculated by multiplying the Event Percentage by the Original Principal Amount on the notes.The Minimum Magnitude for some of the Earthquake Box Locations remain constant for each of the four associated Trigger Levels. For example, the Earthquake Box Location that is bounded by a Minimum Longitude of -123 degrees and Minimum Latitude of 37 degrees (this box covers an area in and around the San Francisco Bay area) has a Minimum Magnitude of 7.5 for each Trigger Level, One through Four. That implies a Covered Event within that box would automatically reach Trigger Level Four and a 100% loss of Outstanding Principal Amount.The Earthquake Box Location that is bounded by a Minimum Longitude of -125 degrees and Minimum Latitude of 44 degrees (this box covers an area along the coast west of Eugene, Oregon) has progressively larger Minimum Magnitudes for each Trigger Level – 8.2, 8.5, 8.7 and 8.9 for Trigger Level One, Two, Three, and Four, respectively. Thus, in a scenario in which a Covered Event within this box had a reported Magnitude of 8.6, Trigger Level Two would be the highest Level reached and would result in a 50% loss of Outstanding Principal Amount.The $200m of notes issued by Acorn Re Ltd. have an initial attachment probability of 0.97%, an exhaustion probability of 0.52% and an expected loss of 0.74%, Artemis understands.The notes are being marketed to investors with coupon guidance in a range of 3.15% to 3.65%, which should be deemed as providing a reasonable multiple to expected loss, being almost 4.3 times at the mid-point of that guidance.Update 1:The Acorn Re 2015-1 cat bond was upsized by 50% to $300m before close, as investors demonstrated their demand for new issuance.At the same time the price guidance was shifted to the midpoint at 3.4% where pricing settled before the deal completed.Update 2:On completion Fitch Ratings assigned a ‘BBsf’ rating to the $300m of notes.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The JPY 5,850,000,000 of notes convert to approximately $47.67m at today’s exchange rate.The transaction that these securitised cat bond notes represent is likely a July reinsurance renewal deal, possibly a quota share as is often the way with private ILS transactions using segregated accounts, with a two-year term.Being denominated in JPY, the Hotaru private cat bond could benefit a Japanese sponsor, perhaps Tokio Millennium Re or even its parent Tokio Marine Group. Alternatively it could be for a Japanese investor, or perhaps an ILS manager with a Japanese denominated insurance-linked investment fund. It’s impossible to confirm at this time.A previous transaction from Shima Re, the $25m Omamori private cat bond from January 2014, was sponsored by Tokio Millennium Re AG itself, so it will be interesting to see whether Hotaru serves a similar purpose or not.The Tokio Tensai™ cat bond issuance platform was set up by Tokio Solution Management Ltd. in cooperation with reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter’s capital markets and cat bond specialist team GC Securities in 2013. We can’t confirm the brokers involvement in this Hotaru deal at this time, but it would seem likely given its cooperation on the Tensai platform.Update:We now know that the underlying risk for the Hotaru private cat bond was Japanese earthquake exposures.Tokio Millennium Re AG, Bermuda branch, acted as a fronting entity so the risk was ceded by it to Shima Re.Tokio Solution Management facilitated the transaction and acts as insurance manager of Shima Reinsurance Ltd.Appleby Securities (Bermuda) Limited acted as listing sponsor.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Panda Re will cover losses suffered from earthquakes across all of the People’s Republic of China, but excluding Hong Kong and Macau.The Panda Re 2015-1 catastrophe bond will use an indemnity trigger and losses will be on a per-occurrence basis.The Panda Re 2015-1 cat bond will have a three-year term, with inception targeted for the 1st July 2015 we understand.China Re is seeking to secure between $50m and $70m of cover from this Panda Re cat bond and we understand that the reinsurer came to market with a range of layer options that it would like to secure coverage for.Panda Re has been launched alongside the China Re reinsurance renewal we believe, so by giving investors a number of options to show interest in the reinsurer is able to test the appetite of the capital markets for Chinese quake risks in cat bond form while also comparing that appetite to traditional reinsurance capital sources.The cat bond was marketed with six layer options, we understand, but the consensus from the ILS and cat bond investor community is said to have converged on a layer that would attach at 2.1 billion Chinese Yuan, which equates to roughly USD$340m.We’re told that the layer will likely be either 400m or 800m Chinese Yuan in size, meaning the notes issued by Panda Re will just cover a percentage of China Re’s losses within that layer.The notes were issued as USD denominated in order to attract the widest possible investor response, with Panda Re’s limit to China Re based on US dollars, but they are positioned alongside certain layers of China Re’s traditional retrocession program.We understand that the book had been coming together to support this attachment level, with an attachment probability of 2.61%, an expected loss of 2.12% and risk spread pricing of 4.1%. China Re is seeking between $50m and $70m of cover at this level, with the $70m preferred.It’s a low coupon and a low multiple of around 1.93 times the initial expected loss, however this is aligned with other diversifying risks which may attract cat bond fund managers. Some ILS investors are likely to forgo the opportunity to invest in Panda Re, as it is a low coupon, but the diversification it offers to others could make it an attractive opportunity.GC Securities is involved in bringing the Panda Re cat bond to market, providing the structuring agent and bookrunning services.

So it seems the reason for including surrounding countries within the covered area is to capture earthquakes that could occur in a neighboring country, but which cause losses to UnipolSai’s portfolio.Protection will be in effect over a 3.5 year term, with maturity scheduled for January 2019. The Azzurro Re I cat bond features an indemnity trigger and will provide the sponsor with per-occurrence protection.The single tranche of Azzurro Re I cat bond notes will cover losses from an attachment point of €500m up to an exhaustion point of €700m, perhaps suggesting the deal could upsize to €200m if investor support allows.The notes have an attachment probability of 0.4%, an exhaustion probability of 0.22% and an expected loss of 0.31%, we’re told.

It will provide the unnamed cedant with a one-year source of fully-collateralized catastrophe reinsurance protection for its Florida book of business.Reinsurance protection is for the peril of Florida named storm risks and the transaction is structured using an indemnity trigger, to more closely match it with other forms of reinsurance the cedant benefits from.The transaction saw the Market Re vehicle, JLTCM’s own issuance vehicle that seeks to make accessing the capital markets cheaper for smaller deals and sponsors, issuing two tranches of Series 2015-3 notes which were marketed and sold to ILS investors.The two tranches provide the cedant with different kinds of reinsurance cover.The first tranche, Class A, is sized at $6.699m of notes and provides both frequency and severity protection, so is structured on an aggregate basis. The second Class B tranche is $24.375m in size and provides per-occurrence protection to the cedant. We understand that the Class A tranche has grown in this years renewal transaction.Structured as zero coupon bonds, the two tranches represent $7.5m of limit for the Class A notes and $25m of limit for the Class B notes.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

As with the previous Oak Leaf Re deals, the cat bond is structured as a zero coupon transaction.There are a number of interesting features in the Oak Leaf Re cat bond which are worth noting.The deal has been structured into three tranches, including one which is multi-section and covers both severity and frequency losses for the cedant. Another of the three classes of notes is designed to provide reinstatement premium protection (RPP), which is an interesting addition that would be attractive to many sponsors.The Class A tranche, which includes $47m of notes covering $50m of limit, provides both severity and frequency protection. In other words, this tranche provides either per-occurrence or aggregate protection and features a shared limit.The Class C tranche, which includes $1.77m of notes, and is a private layer of per-occurrence cover. It sits low down in the reinsurance towers, so is a riskier tranche providing a higher premium to the investors. Being private we don’t have any further details of this tranche.The final Class D tranche, of $4.26m of notes covering $4.5m of limit, provides single-shot per-occurrence protection. This tranche provides the reinstatement premium protection (RPP), effectively the cedant pays upfront for the protection to cover the need to pay for a reinstatement of cover.In terms of pricing, being a private transaction and a zero coupon bond these notes do not have a coupon that is exactly comparable with most cat bond issuance. We understand the Class A tranche priced at a 6% net rate-on-line, relative to the limit, while the Class D tranche priced at 5.33%, again relative to the limit.

Coverage is on a per-occurrence basis and using a parametric index trigger, which will be constructed using actual event parameters reported by the National Hurricane Center.We understand that AIG is seeking just six months of reinsurance protection with this cat bond, to run from the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season on June 1st, to the end of the season on November 30th.The parametric trigger uses pre-defined points around the U.S. Gulf and East coastline and takes into account the location, maximum sustained winds and size (in terms of radius), of any qualifying storm or hurricane.The coverage is for tropical and extra-tropical storms, as well as hurricanes, depressions and post-tropical cyclones, we’re told. Covering all bases with a broad but seemingly well-defined event definition, ensuring that the deal would be in-force for a repeat of superstorm Sandy as well.Protection will kick in at a parametric index value, calculated based on the event parameters, from an index level of 100 up to exhaustion at an index level of 150.We don’t have any details on the probabilities of attachment and expected loss for this deal. We understand that multiple risk modelling companies have assessed the transaction and will provide information to investors who are their subscribers.We’re also told that AIR Worldwide has modelled the cat bond for rating purposes, but as yet the Fitch Ratings report is not available. Once that becomes available we may have more details.Another interesting point about this catastrophe bond is that it has been structured as a zero coupon bond, so investors will receive premium at the end of the transactions term instead of coupon payments. As a result, the sponsor AIG will put the premium into the collateral trust at the start of the deals term, alongside the investors collateral.Also noteworthy about this interesting transaction is the fact that this is the first cat bond to be structured by Rewire Holdings LLC, a firm that launched in September 2014 aiming to increase efficiency in the syndication of catastrophe risk to reinsurance and capital markets.The Compass Re II 2015-1 cat bond is the first to be marketed using Rewire Holdings recently launched web-based marketplace, Rewireconnect, where investors can buy, sell or trade in ILS and catastrophe risk assets.Using the platform will add efficiency to the cat bond transaction process for sponsor AIG and alongside issuing it as a zero coupon bond, which can be considered more cost-effective to issue, should make this deal compelling for them from a cost perspective.Update 1:Further details on the parametric trigger and index for Compass Re II 2015-1 catastrophe bond came available from the ratings report.Fitch explains that the trigger would respond to events on a per occurrence basis, with the underlying trigger factors based on a parametric index. Fitch notes that this means that there will be a basis risk, because the event payout may not be the same as the actual claim experience of AIG.Fitch goes on to explain the mechanics of the parametric trigger and the construction of the index value which would determine whether the Compass Re II cat bond faced a loss or not.The parametric index trigger is based on the following parameters; latitude and longitude of the storm at landfall, radius of the storm and the maximum sustained wind speed. By bringing these factors together with weighting based on the location of landfall, a parametric index value can be determined.Fitch explained:The Windstorm Parameters of latitude and longitude at landfall and radius determine the Parameters X and Y used in calculating the Event Index Value. The Event Index Value is a mathematical formula that multiplies the Parameter X by the Maximum Sustained Wind Speed to the Parameter Y exponent.If the wind speed and radius are not available at landfall, then the largest of the reading just before and after making landfall will be used.If the Windstorm intersects multiple Boundaries, the respective Event Index Values will be summed to determine the Event Percentage (or the amount to be paid to the Ceding Insurer). There is a complicated linear interpolation formula, which is easily traceable in a spreadsheet format.It’s certainly not the most straightforward of parametric triggers, as the event index value is determined largely by where a storm makes landfall. However, that allows AIG to calibrate the trigger to be most responsive in areas where a landfall is expected to cause a greater loss to the insurer, thus helping to reduce basis risk from the sponsors point of view.Fitch continues:Noteholders are exposed to principal loss if the Event Index Value exceeds 100.0 and face total principal loss if the Event Index Value reaches 150.0.Assuming maximum sustained wind speeds of 100 mph and a 100 mile radius, the Notes would be triggered if a wind storm crosses certain parts of New Jersey coastline, but no other areas along the U.S. coastline.Increasing the wind speed to 130 mph while maintaining the 100 mile radius, the Notes could be vulnerable if landfall occurred to certain parts of the Texas, Florida, Virginia and New York coastline. A category 4 hurricane is defined with wind speeds in excess of 130 mph.So clearly the Compass Re II 2015-1 catastrophe bond is particularly sensitive to a New Jersey located hurricane or extra tropical storm landfall, likely as a result of the experience with Sandy.Fitch explains that in terms of historical events, none that it looked at threatened the notes parametric index attachment point.A repeat of Superstorm Sandy would result in an event index value of 25.275, Hurricane Rita would have been 21.642, while Hurricane Frances (a storm that made two landfalls) was just 3.034. Hurricane Camille in 1969 would have resulted in an Event Index Value of 61.135 using on an assumption that the radius of the storm was 90 miles.Risk modelling firm AIR Worldwide provided a modelled analysis for the Compass Re II 2015-1 cat bond notes to assist with the rating process, the firm also acts as calculation agent.AIR simulated 10,000 wind storm events to assess the notes, with its model producing an attachment probability of 2.41% which corresponds to an implied rating of ‘B+’ according to Fitch’s rating methodology.A stress test using the Warm Sea Surface Temperature Conditioned Catalog had an attachment probability of 2.67%. The expected loss for the single tranche of Class A Compass Re II notes is 1.77%, 1.94% for the WSST catalog.Update 2:The Compass Re II 2015-1 cat bond upsized by 50% to reach $300m of notes offered at pricing.The pricing, which began with guidance of 4.5% to 5.25%, finished at 5%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Swiss headquartered ILS fund manager Twelve Capital uses the Dodeka private cat bond series as a way to generate liquid securities out of reinsurance transactions it had collateralized.Twelve Capital uses the Kane SAC private ILS platform, operated by global independent insurance manager Kane, to acquire transformed risk for its more liquid investment strategies and funds, which can be useful for useful for generating diversification, as well as for meeting specific mandates for liquidity either within its own multi-investor funds or as specified by a single investors mandate.Given the timing of the deal, as completing and being listed on the Bermuda Stock Exchange on the 28th May, Dodeka V will involve the securitisation of a June reinsurance renewal deal. As such it’s likely to involve U.S. property catastrophe risks, given the typical focus of the June renewal season for ILS managers like Twelve.Dodeka V represents a segregated account of the Kane SAC Limited private cat bond issuance vehicle. The $18.88m of notes have a due date of the 22nd December 2015, so represent a six month reinsurance contract.All of the previous Dodeka private cat bonds were transformed from industry-loss warranty (ILW) contracts, so used PCS industry loss triggers covering U.S. natural perils. We can’t confirm what the underlying structure is with Dodeka V, but it is likely to again be an ILW as they provide the simplest transactional features for transformation, making them the most cost-effective way to acquire risk in a liquid securitised form.By listing the $18.8m of Dodeka V notes on the Bermuda Stock exchange Twelve Capital can enhance their liquidity, providing the ILS manager with improved options and additional transparency to trade the notes on the secondary cat bond market. As a result the notes can be priced by ILS broker desks, giving the market visibility of their pricing and increasing options for liquidity and transferability.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

A newly Cayman Islands vehicle, Residential Reinsurance 2015 Limited will seek to sell two tranches of notes to ILS investors, to collateralized the underlying reinsurance agreements.The reinsurance protection provided by the cat bond will cover USAA for certain losses suffered from tropical cyclones (and flood for rented property policies), earthquakes (and fire following), severe thunderstorms, winter storms, wildfires, volcanic eruption and meteorite impacts.The protection afforded by the two tranches of notes will be on an indemnity trigger and annual aggregate basis, over a four-year term against losses suffered from the above perils across the U.S. and District of Columbia.A Class 10 tranche of notes is being marketed with an initial size of $50m and will cover losses from an attachment point of $959m up to an exhaustion at $1.134 billion. That equates to an initial attachment probability of 8.33%, an exhaustion probability of 4.63% and an expected loss of 6.2% base, 7.28% sensitivity case.A $100m tranche of Class 11 notes are less risky, covering losses from an attachment point of $1.134 billion up to an exhaustion point of $1.791 billion. That gives these notes an initial attachment probability of 4.63%, an exhaustion probability of 0.89% and an expected loss of 2.16% base, 2.5% sensitivity case.So the Class 10 notes are significantly more risky than the Class 11.The Class 10 notes are being offered with coupon price guidance of 10.75% to 11.75%. That would suggest a multiple of just 1.9x’s the base expected loss, or 1.6x the sensitivity case, even if it priced at the top end of guidance. That is a low multiple by any degree of analysis, especially for a riskier tranche.The Class 11 tranche are being offered to investors with price guidance of 5.5% to 6%, suggesting a multiple of 2.8x’s the base expected loss, or 2.4x the sensitivity case, again taking the top end of price guidance.Update 1:The Class 10 notes launched with price guidance of 10.75% to 11.75%, which showed USAA’s ambitions to secure the cover at a very low multiple. Now, Artemis understands that the price guidance has been fixed at 11%, near the lower end of that range.So if final pricing is set at an 11% coupon, the Class 10 notes will have a multiple of 1.77 times the base expected loss or 1.51 times the sensitivity case. That’s a particularly low multiple, which clearly reflects the appetite of investors to access higher yielding cat bond notes and their willingness to accept a lower multiple payment in return.Class 11 launched with price guidance of 5.5% to 6% and interestingly these notes have had the guidance fixed at the top end of guidance, at 6%. That suggests a multiple of 2.8x’s the base expected loss, or 2.4x the sensitivity case.Update, March 23rd 2018:USAA’s aggregated losses from catastrophe events in the current risk period have now reached roughly $1 billion, suggesting that these 2015-1 Class 10 notes are now getting close to being triggered. With some months left until the end of the risk period and the next reset, there is the potential for noteholders of this tranche to face some level of principal loss.Update June 4th 2019:It appears that a reinsurance recovery may have been made under these Residential Re 2015-1 cat bond tranchesThe Residential Reinsurance 2015 Limited (Series 2015-1) aggregate cat bond transaction has seen the net principal amount of its $50 million Class 10 notes reduced by almost half to $26,511,039, while the $100 million of Class 11 notes has seen its net principal amount reduced by 50% to $50 million.Both of these ResRe 2015-1 tranches of cat bonds have had their maturities further extended to September 6th 2019.The Class 10 notes issued by ResRe 2015 were marked down for an almost total loss, for bids as low as 7, while the Class 11 notes were marked down by brokers for roughly a 50% loss of principal.Update, September 3rd 2019:The Class 10 notes of this cat bond had already seen their net principal amount of $50 million reduced by almost half to $26,511,039. This tranche has now had the maturity of its remaining notes extended to December 6th 2019.But the Class 11 tranche of the ResRe 2015-1 notes, which were $100 million in size but saw its net principal amount reduced by 50% to $50 million, has now been reduced by another $10 million, leaving $40 million remaining and these notes are also now extended to maturity at December 6th.Update, December 3rd 2019:The Class 10 notes that already had their net principal amount of $50 million reduced by almost half to $26,511,039 is also extended to March 6th 2020.But the Class 11 tranche of the ResRe 2015-1 cat bond deal, which were originally $100 million in size, but saw reductions in principal of $40 million and then another $10 million, leaving $40 million still outstanding, have now seen another reduction in net principal taking the outstanding notes left down to just $20 million, while also being extended until March 6th 2020.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Coverage for these perils is across northeast U.S. states, on a per-occurrence basis and the cat bond features an indemnity trigger.The covered U.S. states include Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and Vermont.The Long Point Re III 2015-1 cat bond covers a number of Travelers insurance companies, Travelers Indemnity, Travelers Casualty & Surety, St. Paul Fire and Marine and The Standard Fire Insurance Company, as well as any associated subsidiaries of each.The notes will attach at $2 billion of losses and cover losses up to an exhaustion point of $2.5 billion, however we’re told this is after a retention of at least 10% of event losses and a maximum per covered insurer of $20m per risk.Fitch Ratings explained the subject business:The Total Insured Limit of the Subject Business for Tropical Cyclone is about $1.4 trillion and is split 61% personal insurance and 39% commercial insurance (based on the Initial Data excluding non-modeled exposures). Within the commercial business, 12.9% is classified as First Party – National Property which may pay for business interruption losses. Over 41% of the commercial business has a Total Replacement Cost in excess of $20 million. However, with respect to each insured, the maximum amount of losses to be included in ‘Losses’, whether paid or as loss reserves, is initially limited to $20 million (Initial Single Risk Cap). This limit may be increased to no more than $40 million upon any Reset.That results in an initial attachment probability of 1.276%, an initial exhaustion probability of 0.946% and an expected loss of 1.106% base case, or 1.176% on a sensitivity case basis.Price guidance for the Long Point Re III 2015-1 Class A notes is set at 3.5% to 4%, which suggests a multiple of around 3x the sensitivity case expected loss at the lower end of pricing.We understand that this catastrophe bond features a variable reset feature, now typical in cat bonds, and also a call option, which is becoming typical for large primary insurers allowing them an early redemption opportunity.Fitch Ratings on historical events that could affect the cat bond:On a historical basis, Travelers have not experienced any actual natural catastrophe losses that would have triggered a loss event on this class of notes. Only as a point of reference, Travelers reported total case incurred losses of $1.6 billion for Hurricane Katrina (which included areas outside the Covered Area of this note) and $0.8 billion for Superstorm Sandy. Likewise, the largest winter storm event in 2014 was less than $150 million. These reported losses were not limited by the Single Risk Cap mentioned above.And on the risk modelling, Fitch explained:Nearly 83% of the Modeled Trigger Probability is attributable to Tropical Cyclones. Severe Thunderstorms represent almost 12%, while Earthquake and Winter Storms represent 5% and 1%, respectively. This reflects the ‘per occurrence’ trigger feature of the 2015-1 notes where a significant event needs to occur versus multiple aggregate events. In addition, historical data surrounding northeast U.S. earthquake is limited. As can be expected, the State of New York accounts for the largest modeled expected loss at 36% with Connecticut and New Jersey each representing 14.0%. The AIR Risk Analysis did not include the potential 1.10 Growth Limitation Factor. It included both economic demand surge and storm water surge. Secondary perils of fire following earthquakes and sprinkler leakage were included. The data quality and detail provided to AIR appears robust.Update 1:The Long Point Re III 2015-1 cat bond looks set to upsize to as much as $300m, after the marketing guidance saw the size target changed.At the same time the price guidance range was narrowed and moved towards the upper end of initial guidance, at 3.75% to 4%.Update 2:The cat bond upsized by 50% to reach the $300m in size offered before close.At the same time the pricing eventually settled at the mid-point of initial guidance, at 3.75%.The multiple, of expected loss to coupon, comes out at roughly 3.4x’s the expected loss base case and 3.2x at the sensitivity case.The cat bond has a variable reset, at which the risk interest spread can be reduced to a minimum of 3.5% and an upper bound of 4.38%, when the attachment is adjusted accordingly.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

It covers losses from both personal and commercial residential property exposures in the Florida Citizens coastal account over a three-year period.The 2015-1 Class A notes will have an initial attachment point of $6.256 billion of losses to Florida Citizens, with an exhaustion point at $7.05 billion.

TWIA will enter into a reinsurance agreement with Hannover Rück SE and then enter into a retrocession agreement with Alamo Re Ltd. to effect the transaction.Alamo Re Ltd. will seek to issue two tranches of Series 2015-1 notes, with a total initial size of $450m, a $200m Class A tranche of notes and a $250m Class B tranche.The proceeds of the sale of the notes will be used to collateralize the underlying reinsurance agreements and ultimately provide TWIA with a source of reinsurance protection for named storm risks (so tropical storm and hurricane) in the State of Texas.The Alamo Re 2015-1 cat bond will provide its protection using an indemnity trigger and on an annual aggregate basis. The Class A tranche of notes will cover TWIA for three years, while the Class B tranche will provide four years of protection.The $200m Class A tranche of notes are the riskier of the two, with an attachment point at $2.6 billion of losses and an exhaustion point at $3.2 billion. That is equal to an initial attachment probability of 2.74%, an initial exhaustion probability of 2.14% and an initial expected loss of 2.46% base case (2.68% sensitivity case). These notes will provide TWIA with coverage until June 2018.The $250m Class B tranche of notes attach at $4 billion of losses and exhaust at $4.8 billion. That equates to an attachment probability of 1.61%, an exhaustion probability of 1.3% and an expected loss of 1.42% at the base case (1.58% sensitivity case). These notes cover TWIA until June 2019.Launch price guidance has been set at 5.4% to 5.9% for the riskier Class A notes, suggesting a multiple of at least 2 times the sensitivity case expected loss, and 4.25% to 4.75% for the Class B notes, suggesting a multiple of at least 2.6 times the expected loss.The pricing is a little lower than that seen in 2014, as you’d expect, however the multiples to expected loss remain roughly aligned between the 2014 Alamo Re and the proposed pricing levels of the 2015 cat bond, even at the lower end of pricing.TWIA has split the coverage from this cat bond into two layers, which will allow it to spread the fully collateralized, catastrophe bond sourced component of its reinsurance programme within its tower. That’s a sensible move from a diversification of risk capital point of view, something that is important to insurers like the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association.The Alamo Re Ltd. (Series 2015-1) catastrophe bond is being brought to market by sole structuring agent and bookrunner GC Securities, while AIR Worldwide is risk modeller.Update 1:The Alamo Re 2015-1 cat bond upsized significantly, by almost 56%, to $700m in total size before close.The Class A tranche of notes grew by 50% to $300m and the Class B tranche by 60% to $400m.Pricing settled at or near the upper end of initial guidance.The Class A notes pricing settled at 5.9%. With an expected loss of 2.46% base case (2.68% sensitivity case) that suggests a multiple of 2.4x at the base case, 2.2x sensitivity case.The Class B saw pricing just below the top end of guidance, at 4.6%. With an expected loss of 1.42% at the base case (1.58% sensitivity case), the multiple looks likely to be 3.2x at the base case, 2.9x sensitivity case.Fitch Ratings had the following to say on the 2015-1 Alamo Re cat bond in a pre-sale announcement:Fitch Ratings expects to rate the Series 2015-1 Principal At-Risk Variable Rate Notes issued by Alamo Re Ltd., a registered special purpose insurer in Bermuda, as follows:–Class A Notes expected to mature Jun. 7, 2018 ‘B+sf’; –Class B Notes expected to mature Jun. 7, 2019 ‘BB-sf’;The Rating Outlook for each class within the Series 2015-1 Notes is Stable. Neither the principal amounts nor the risk interest spreads have been determined.Fitch has also placed on Rating Watch Positive, the ‘Bsf’ rating for the Alamo Re Ltd. Series 2014-1 Class A Principal At-Risk Variable Rate Notes expected to mature Jun. 7, 2017, in connection with the Reset Report dated April 3, 2015 which has outlined the election to lower the annual attachment probability of the Series 2014-1 Notes, effective as of the first Reset Date, June 1, 2015.TRANSACTION SUMMARYThe Series 2015-1 Class A and B Notes provide multi-year protection for the Subject Business written by the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) on an annual aggregate basis using an indemnity trigger. The notes are exposed to insured property losses due to ‘named storms’ within the covered area, which solely covers the 14 first-tier, coastal counties of Texas (and a small portion of Harris County). The Subject Business represents a total insured value of $86.9 billion (as of Dec. 15, 2014) and consists of residential coverage (86.3%), commercial coverage (13.6%) with very minimal mobile home coverage (0.1%). Galveston and Brazoria counties represent approximately half of the total insured value with 30.2% and 19.6%, respectively.Series 2015-1 Class A noteholders are subject to principal loss (and reduced interest) if annual aggregate ultimate net losses exceed the initial attachment level of $2.6 billion and a total loss of principal occurs if the annual aggregate ultimate net losses reach the reach the initial exhaustion level of $3.2 billion in the first 12-month risk period. The Series 2015-1 Class B Notes have an initial attachment level of $4.0 billion and an exhaustion level of $4.8 billion. A named storm must generate at least $50 million in ultimate net losses to be included in the aggregate totals. Based on the profile of the subject business and the attachment level, the third party modeling firm AIR Worldwide (AIR) calculates the modeled annual attachment probability on the Series 2015-1 Class A Notes to be 2.74%, which implies a ‘B+sf’ rating per Fitch’s criteria. The Series 2015-1 Class B Notes have an initial probability of attachment of 1.61%, which implies a ‘BB-sf’ rating.Fitch currently rates the Alamo Re Ltd. 2014-1 Class A Notes at ‘Bsf’ and has received notification from AIR, which serves as the Reset Agent, that the modeled attachment probability of the transaction will be lowered to 2.09% from its initial annual attachment probability of 3.80%. The reset will move the attachment level of the 2014-1 Class A Notes up to $3.2 billion from the initial attachment level of $1.9 billion and will increase its insurance percentage to 50% of its respective layer, up from approximately 30%. As of the Reset Date, June 1, 2015, the Series 2014-1 Class A Notes are expected to be layered in between the Series 2015-1 Class A and Class B Notes. AIR has also recalculated the risk interest spread for the 2014-1 Class A Notes, which is expected to decrease to 5.24% from the initial spread of 6.35%.TWIA will retain at least 5% of the aggregate ultimate net loss on a first-dollar basis, covering the first $600 million. Above this retention, the company has the ability to issue up to $2.5 billion of public securities funded by premium surcharges to policyholders and assessments on TWIA member companies. Above the modeled attachment level for the Series 2015-1 Class A Notes of $2.6 billion, claim losses are shared between noteholders and traditional reinsurers up to $3.2 billion on a pro-rata basis depending on the ultimate deal size.After the Series 2015-1 Class A Notes are exhausted, the Alamo Re Ltd. Series 2014-1 Class A Notes are expected to have an attachment level of $3.2 billion and share 50% of aggregate ultimate net losses with traditional reinsurers up to $4.0 billion.The Series 2015-1 Class B Notes then have an attachment level of $4.0 billion and share aggregate ultimate net loss between its noteholders and traditional reinsurers up to $4.8 billion on a pro-rata basis depending on the ultimate deal size.On a historical basis, there have been 37 hurricanes that have made landfall in Texas since 1900. Recent hurricanes, Dolly and Ike (two events in 2008) and Rita (2005) would not have caused a principal loss to either the Series 2015-1 Class A or Class B Notes. Modeled results for four hurricanes prior to 1933 would have totally exhausted the 2015-1 Class A Notes. The Series 2015-1 Class B Notes would only have been exhausted by the nameless storm that occurred in 1900, while the nameless storm of 1915 would have caused a 63.6% principal loss.There are three annual risk periods for the Series 2015-1 Class A Notes and four for the Series 2015-1 Class B over the term of the notes. The Series 2015-1 Notes will reset on June 1, 2016 and June 1, 2017 (as well as June 1, 2018 for 2015-1 Class B) using AIR’s escrowed software models and TWIA’s updated subject business data. At each reset date, TWIA may exercise an option to decrease (or increase) the respective attachment levels on each of the classes within an exceedance probability range of 4.40% to 1.00%. The implied rating under Fitch’s criteria at a 4.40% exceedance probability is ‘Bsf’, and the implied rating at 1.00% is ‘BB-sf’. If such an option is exercised by TWIA at either reset date, the applicable risk interest spreads will be recalculated to reflect the increased (or decreased) level of risk assumed by the noteholders. If TWIA does not elect to reset the attachment level, the reset agent will adjust the respective attachment level to maintain the initial exceedance probabilities using the updated subject business profile.The applicable Class of Series 2015-1 notes may be extended for thirty-six additional months if certain qualifying events occur, or at the discretion of Hannover Ruck SE, a reinsurance company that acts as a transformer and sits between TWIA and Alamo Re Ltd.. However, the Series 2015-1 Notes are not exposed to any further catastrophe events during this extension (only further claim development of existing events). The notes may be redeemed before the expected maturity date in response to specific early redemption events. The repayment of the Notes to the noteholders occurs subsequent to any qualified payments to TWIA for covered events. Noteholders have no recourse to TWIA (or to its transformer reinsurer, Hannover Ruck SE).Alamo Re Ltd. ultimately ‘follows the fortunes’ of TWIA in regards to underwriting of new business and claim management practices over the respective three and four year risk periods for the 2015-1 Class A and Class B Notes. TWIA was established by the Texas Legislature in 1971 as a residual insurer of last resort. Although applicants must have been denied coverage by at least one commercial insurer, all properties insured by TWIA must be certified as built to specified building codes, must have flood insurance coverage in specified flood areas and have maximum limits per residential dwelling of $1,773,000 (higher limits are available for commercial structures).KEY RATING DRIVERSThe rating is based on the evaluation of the natural catastrophe risk, the business profile of TWIA, the counterparty risk of the transformer reinsurer (Hannover Ruck SE) and the credit risk of the collateral assets. The natural catastrophe risk represents the weakest link and currently drives the ratings of the Series 2015-1 Notes.The rating analysis in support of the evaluation of the natural catastrophe risk is highly model-driven. As with any model of complex physical systems, particularly those with low frequencies of occurrence and potentially high severity outcomes, the actual losses from catastrophic events may differ from the results of simulation analyses. Fitch is neutral to any of the major catastrophe modeling firms that is selected by the issuer to provide the modeling analysis, and thus Fitch did not include any explicit margins or qualitative haircuts to the probability of loss metric provided by the modeling firm.The initial modeled annual attachment probabilities for the Series 2015-1 Class A and Class B Notes were initially estimated at 2.74% and 1.61%, respectively, based on 10,000 simulations of a one-year risk period as calculated by AIR using their methodology and proprietary models (Version 16.0 of the AIR Hurricane Model for the United States as implemented in Touchstone 2.0.2 and CATRADER 16.0). Results from other possible modelers or from TWIA were not provided. Sensitivity analysis provided by AIR indicated the implied ratings would be no worse than ‘B+sf’ for Series 2015-1 Class A and ‘BB-sf’ for Series 2015-1 Class B.The risk modeling included certain stresses for economic demand surge, storm surge and an initial loss adjustment expense factor of 1.10. The modeled results did not include the possibility that the average annual loss may increase by up to 1.10 in any annual risk period. The AIR model does not model the probability of losses resulting from tropical storms that at no point are classified as a hurricane, hurricanes that degrade to tropical storm force and subsequently make landfall in the U.S. as a tropical storm, as well as storms that never make landfall in the U.S. that fail to cause winds of greater than or equal to 74 mph over any point in the U.S. Thus, the model understates claim losses to named storms not recognized as hurricanes or hurricanes that become degraded. Noteholders are exposed to this basis risk or the difference between actual net losses incurred by TWIA and the AIR modeled net losses.Fitch did not rate TWIA in connection with the note issuance but believes certain other safeguards are in place for noteholders: TWIA is subject to review, oversight and approval by the Texas Department of Insurance (though it receives no federal, state or local funds for support); there is an independent claim reviewer and loss reserve specialist (Deloitte Ltd.) for Alamo Re Ltd. Series 2015-1 Notes; and the data quality of the subject business provided to AIR appears adequate.Hannover Ruck SE (IDR ‘AA-‘; Outlook Stable) acts as the transformer reinsurer for TWIA and Alamo Re Ltd.. Noteholders are exposed to the risk that Hannover Ruck SE does not pass along retrocession premiums to Alamo Re Ltd. These premiums are a key component in the coupon payment to noteholders.Proceeds from the issuance of each Class within the Series 2015-1 Notes will be held in a collateral account and used to purchase high-credit-quality money market funds meeting defined eligibility criteria; otherwise funds will be held in cash. Investment yields generated from these permitted investments are passed directly to noteholders of the applicable Class of Series 2015-1 Notes as the other component of the interest payment. Noteholders are exposed to possible market value risk if the net asset value of a money market fund falls below $1.00. Finally, certain actions may be required if the collateral account is invested in money market funds and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is deemed to apply in late 2016.RATING SENSITIVITIESThis rating is sensitive to the occurrence of a qualifying event(s), TWIA’s election to reset the applicable Class within the Series 2015-1 Notes’ attachment levels, changes in the data quality or purpose of TWIA, the counterparty rating of Hannover Ruck SE and the rating on the assets held in the respective collateral account.If qualifying covered events occur that causes annual aggregate losses to exceed either the Series 2015-1 Class A or Class B attachment levels, Fitch will downgrade the applicable Class of Notes reflecting an effective default and issue a Recovery Rating.In the case of a reset election by TWIA, the rating of the Series 2015-1 Class A and Class B Notes, movement from the respective initial attachment probabilities closer to an attachment probability of 4.00% could lead to downgrades of the applicable Class(es) to as low as ‘Bsf’. Conversely, if TWIA elected to move the Series 2015-1 Class B attachment probability closer to 1.00%, the rating on the Notes would be unaffected, while a reset of the Series 2015-1 Class A attachment probability to as low as 1.00% could result in an upgrade to as high as ‘BB-sf’.To a lesser extent, the Series 2015-1 Notes may be downgraded if the money market funds should ‘break the buck’, Hannover Ruck SE fails to make timely retrocession premium payments or TWIA materially changes its mission or operations.The AIR escrow models may not reflect future methodology enhancements by AIR which may have an adverse or beneficial effect on the implied rating of the notes were such future methodology considered.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

BNP Paribas and Aon Benfield Securities are joint bookrunners.","RMS","Excess mortality (France, Japan, U.S.)","$305m","Mortality index","S&P: Class A - 'BB+sf', Class B - 'BBsf'","Apr 2015","Benu Capital Limited, a newly formed Irish special purpose vehicle, will seek to issue two tranches of mortality linked notes totaling €285m (US$305m) in order to collateralize a reinsurance agreement with AXA Global Life.The mortality bond notes will provide AXA Global Life with excess mortality protection for France, Japan and the U.S. over a five year period from January 2015 to the end of 2019, Artemis understands.The transaction utilises an ISDA-based risk transfer contract providing excess mortality protection, above the specified mortality index attachment points, on an annual aggregate basis over the five year term to the issuer.The Benu Capital mortality cat bond notes will be linked to a mortality index trigger, which is weighted by both age and gender within for each covered region. As a result, each region will have its own trigger point for each of the two tranches of excess mortality-linked notes.The Benu Capital Class A notes, sized at €150m, will have an attachment probability of 1.06%, an exhaustion probability of 0.44% and an expected loss of 0.64%. These notes are being marketed with price guidance of 2.15% to 2.65%.The Class A notes will trigger at a mortality index level of 116% for France, 116% for Japan and 108% in the U.S. The exhaustion points are 152.7% for France, 140.8% for Japan and 120.4% for the U.S.These notes also feature a dropdown level for each region, set at 110% for France, 110% for Japan and 106% for the U.S. We understand they would dropdown if the coverage from the Class B tranche, which are riskier, was eroded or exhausted during the five year term of the deal.The Class B notes are sized at €100m, have an attachment probability of 1.79%, an exhaustion probability of 1.33% and an expected loss of 1.33%. These notes are being marketed with price guidance of 2.9% to 3.5%.The Class B notes will trigger at a mortality index level of 108.1% for France, 108.2% for Japan and 104.1% in the U.S. The exhaustion points are 116% for France, 116% for Japan and 108% for the U.S.So Class B is the riskier of the two slices of excess mortality reinsurance protection. As with all excess mortality deals the key risks covered are pandemic or disease events, such as severe flu outbreaks and the like, but events such as war, earthquakes, terrorism etc are also modelled. Data to report mortality rates within each covered area are taken from the main government statistical reporting agencies.Standard & Poor’s noted that there is a remote risk of unmodelled events occurring that could trigger the notes, such as a tsunami, epidemic, perhaps war or major terrorism event. It’s impossible to model all potential events in a mortality transaction, meaning that some unmodelled risk will always be present.Similarly uncertainty is present due to medical advances and changes in lifestyle, which can affect mortality rates dramatically. Scientific development of vaccines and other drugs could reduce mortality rates dramatically in the future. However changes in lifestyle could affect them negatively.Also a minor concern is the fact that as world populations grow the frequency and severity of future pandemics or epidemics can increase as well, due to factors such as increasing population density and rising global air travel rates.To counter these factors the risk modelling for the transaction stresses pandemic and epidemic risks, and also reviews and stresses mortality improvement factors as well. S&P itself also considered a qualitative assessment of various event scenarios that could affect the bond.S&P rated the Class A notes ‘BB+sf’, and the Class B notes ‘BBsf’.Update 1:According to sources, the Benu Capital mortality cat bond looks like it may increase in size before completion.The Class A tranche is likely to be sized at €120m to €150m, depending on demand.Meanwhile the Class B tranche of notes is expected to be sized somewhere in the range of €130m to €160m.Between the two tranches that should still ensure a total deal size of at least €250m, in fact we’re told that is now the minimum target, but with a good chance that investor demand could lift the deal above that size by its completion. It could get as large as €310m if both tranches hit the upper end of those ranges.It’s worth noting that the Class B notes are the riskier of the two, so will pay a higher coupon, demonstrating that investors continue to have more appetite for the higher yielding tranches of notes as this tranche is certain to upsize according to the numbers above.The Class A tranche pricing has moved up towards the upper end of initial guidance at 2.55%.The Class B, riskier tranche has also moved above the mid-point, towards the upper end, with price guidance now listed as 3.35%.The Class A notes have an initial base expected loss of 0.64%, which with pricing at 2.55% would provide a multiple of nearly 4x and a spread above expected loss of 1.91%.Class B has an initial base expected loss of 1.33%, which with pricing at 3.35% would mean a multiple of 2.5x and a spread above expected loss of 2.02%.Update 2:At final pricing the Benu Capital deal did indeed upsize and investors showed that the higher risk and return Class B layer was the preferred.Sources told Artemis that the Class A notes settled at a size of €135m, while the Class B notes grew to €150m, giving the overall size of €285m.In terms of pricing there has been no change from the update above. The Class A tranche priced at 2.55% and the Class B at 3.35%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Cranberry Re Ltd. (Series 2015-1)","Cranberry Re Ltd. (Series 2015-1)","Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association / Hannover Ruck SE","GC Securities is sole structuring agent and bookrunner","AIR Worldwide","Massachusetts named storm, severe thunderstorm & winter storm","$300m","Indemnity","Fitch: 'Bsf'","Apr 2015","For this transaction Hannover Rück SE is sponsoring the catastrophe bond on behalf of the reinsured, Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association (MPIUA), using newly established Bermudian special purpose insurer Cranberry Re Ltd.Cranberry Re Ltd. will issue a single tranche of Series 2015-1 Class A notes, currently proposing a $200m issue, which will be sold to investors to collateralize a reinsurance agreement between the MPIUA and Hannover Re.The notes will ultimately provide the MPIUA with a fully-collateralized source of reinsurance protection against losses from State of Massachusetts named storms (so tropical storm and hurricane risks, severe thunderstorms and winter storms.The protection from the Cranberry Re 2015-1 cat bond notes will provide protection on an indemnity and annual aggregate basis over a three-year period, covering any losses suffered under the reinsurance agreement between the pre-defined attachment and exhaustion levels.The Cranberry Re 2015-1 Class A notes will have an attachment point at $300m of losses and an exhaustion point set at $1.4 billion, suggesting the notes will only cover a percentage of the MPIUA’s losses within that layer of its reinsurance programme.The initial attachment probability will be 3.081%, the initial exhaustion probability 0.697% and the expected loss 1.377% on a base case (1.383% sensitivity case).We understand that the Cranberry Re 2015-1 notes will be marketed with a coupon guidance range of 3.8% to 4.3%, suggesting a multiple of around 3 times the expected loss.Fitch Ratings has already published a pre-rating note on the bond, in which it provides the following details:The MPIUA represents a total insured value of $97.5 billion or a 12% market share (based on 2013 premium). The subject business consists of homeowners (91%) and dwelling coverage (9%) with very minimal commercial coverage (<1%).Significant coastal counties; such as Barnstable (Cape Cod area) and Suffolk (Boston area), have the largest exposure at 29.5% and 14.6%, respectively. Other notable coastal counties, Dukes (Martha’s Vineyard area) and Nantucket, have 4.8% and 3.2% of the total insured value, respectively.A covered event within the risk period, July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2018, must cause at least $10 million of ultimate net loss to MPIUA to qualify. Notable recent events would be considered a covered event but not significant to cause a principal loss to the Series 2015-1 Notes. Of the multiple winter storms in 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, the only covered event has an estimated $14.4 million of incurred claims.Recent ‘named storms’ Superstorm Sandy (October 2012) had total losses of $10.1 million and Hurricane Irene (August 2011) would not have qualified. The most damaging event caused by wind and thunderstorms occurred in May 2011 and had $16.8 million of total paid losses.Initially, noteholders are subject to principal loss (and reduced interest) if the annual aggregate ultimate net losses exceed the attachment point of $300 million and a total loss of principal occurs if the severity reaches $1.4 billion in the first twelve-month risk period. Based on the profile of the subject business and the attachment point, the third party modeling firm AIR Worldwide (AIR) calculates the modeled annual attachment probability to be 3.081%, which implies a ‘Bsf’ rating per Fitch’s criteria. It should be noted that the threshold between a ‘B’ and ‘B+’ rating is 3.02% (in other words, Fitch may have rated the note ‘B+’ if the attachment probability was slightly lower). The modeled expected loss is 1.377%.There will be three annual risk periods over the term of the notes, with the ‘reset’ occurring on July 1, 2016 and July 1, 2017 using AIR’s escrowed software models and MPIUA’s updated subject business data and loss adjustment expense factor. At each reset date, MPIUA may exercise an option to decrease (or increase) the attachment levels within a rather wide exceedance probability range of 4.00% to 1.50%. The implied rating under Fitch’s criteria at a 4.00% exceedance probability is ‘Bsf,’ and the implied rating at 1.50% is ‘BB-sf’. If such an option is exercised by MPIUA at either reset date, the risk interest spread will be recalculated to reflect the increased (or decreased) level of risk assumed by the noteholders. If MPIUA does not elect to reset the attachment levels, the reset agent will adjust the attachment level and exhaustion level to maintain the initial 3.081% exceedance probability using the updated subject business profile.The notes may be extended for 36 additional months if certain qualifying events occur, or at the discretion of Hannover Ruck SE, a reinsurance company that acts as a transformer and sits between MPIUA and Cranberry Re. However, the notes are not exposed to any further catastrophe events during this extension (only further claim development of existing events). The notes may be redeemed at any time due to regulatory or tax law changes or partially by MPIUA during the extension period or under certain early redemption events. The repayment of the notes to the noteholders occurs subsequent to any qualified payments to MPIUA for covered events. Noteholders have no recourse to MPIUA (or to its transformer, Hannover Ruck SE).KEY RATING DRIVERSThe rating is based on the evaluation of the natural catastrophe risk, the business profile of MPIUA, the counterparty risk of the transformer reinsurer (Hannover Ruck SE) and the credit risk of the collateral assets. The natural catastrophe risk represents the weakest link and currently drives the rating of the Series 2015-1 Notes.The rating analysis in support of the evaluation of the natural catastrophe risk is highly model-driven. As with any model of complex physical systems, particularly those with low frequencies of occurrence and potentially high severity outcomes, the actual losses from catastrophic events may differ from the results of simulation analyses. Fitch is neutral to any of the major catastrophe modeling firms that is selected by the issuer to provide the modeling analysis, and thus Fitch did not include any explicit margins or qualitative haircuts to the probability of loss metric provided by the modeling firm.The probability of loss was initially estimated at 3.081% based on 100,000 simulations of a one-year risk period as calculated by AIR using their methodology and proprietary models (Version 16.0 of the AIR Hurricane model for the United States, version 7.0 of the AIR Severe Thunderstorm model for the United States, version 1.7 of the AIR Winter Storm model for the United States, each as implemented in Touchstone version 2.0.2). Results from other possible modelers or from MPIUA were not provided. Sensitivity analysis provided by AIR indicated the implied rating would be no worse than ‘Bsf’.The model estimates ‘named storms’ contribute 96.3% of the annual expected loss, with winter storms and severe thunderstorms being 2.2% and 1.5%, respectively. In addition, of the simulated years that produced aggregate ultimate net losses exceeding the attachment level, 49.8% are attributed to a single event in the year, while years with two events would represent another 32.9%. Within the record of actual historical events, only four hurricanes (if replicated and applied to the current subject business) would lead to a partial principal loss – notably, Hurricanes Donna (1960) and Bob (1991) would have produced a 27.4% and 20.0% principal loss.The risk modeling included certain stresses for economic demand surge, storm surge and a loss adjustment expense factor of 1.065. The modeled results did not include the possibility that the average annual loss may increase by up to 1.10 in any annual risk period. The model simulates only hurricane activity making landfall, thus it understates claim losses to named storms not recognized as hurricanes or hurricanes that become degraded. Noteholders are exposed to this basis risk or the difference between actual net losses incurred by MPIUA and the AIR modeled net losses.Cranberry Re Ltd. ultimately ‘follows the fortunes’ of MPIUA in regards to underwriting of new business over the next three years and claim management practices. MPIUA was established by the Massachusetts Legislature in 1968 as a residual insurer of last resort solely for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and employs approximately 150 people. It is a for-profit organization organized by an association of over 500 member insurers. Business can be placed by licensed agents, brokers or directly by consumers. All properties insured by MPIUA must be certified as built to specified building codes, must have flood insurance coverage in specified flood areas and have maximum limits per residential dwelling of $1,000,000 (higher limits are available for commercial structures).Fitch does not rate MPIUA but believes certain safeguards are in place for noteholders. MPIUA is subject to review, oversight and approval by the Massachusetts Department of Insurance (though it receives no federal, state or local funds for support); there is an independent claim reviewer and loss reserve specialist (Towers Watson Ltd., Bermuda) for Cranberry Re Ltd.; and the data quality of the Subject Business provided to AIR appears good. For this particular peril and transaction, MPIUA will retain at least 5% of the aggregate ultimate net loss on a first-dollar basis, covering the first $100 million.. Above this retention, claim losses are paid by traditional reinsurers until reaching the attachment point, where losses are shared between noteholders and reinsurers on a pro-rata basis depending on the ultimate deal size.Hannover Ruck SE (IDR: ‘AA-‘; Rating Outlook Stable by Fitch) acts as the transformer for MPIUA and Cranberry Re Ltd.. Noteholders are exposed to the counterparty risk that Hannover Ruck SE does not pass along retrocession premiums to Cranberry Re Ltd.. These premiums are a key component in the coupon payment to noteholders.Proceeds from this issuance will be held in a collateral account and used to purchase high-credit-quality money market funds meeting defined eligibility criteria, otherwise funds will be held in cash. Investment yields generated from these permitted investments are passed directly to noteholders as the other component. Noteholders are exposed to possible market value risk if the net asset value of a money market fund falls below $1.00. Finally, certain actions may be required if the collateral account is invested in money market funds and FATCA is deemed to apply in late 2016.RATING SENSITIVITIESThis rating is sensitive to the occurrence of a qualifying event(s), MPIUA’s election to reset the note’s attachment level, changes in the data quality or purpose of MPIUA, the counterparty rating of Hannover Ruck SE and the rating on the assets held in the collateral account.If qualifying covered events occur that cause annual aggregate losses to exceed the attachment level, Fitch will downgrade the notes reflecting an effective default and issue a Recovery Rating.In the case of a reset election by MPIUA, the rating would not be sensitive to a movement from the initial 3.081% exceedance probability to a probability as high as 4.00%, since both probabilities imply a ‘Bsf’ rating. However, if MPIUA elected to move closer to an exceedance probability approaching 1.50%, the notes at that time could be upgraded to as high as ‘BB-sf’.To a lesser extent, the notes may be downgraded if the money market funds should ‘break the buck’, Hannover Ruck SE fails to make timely retrocession premium payments or MPIUA materially changes its mission or operations.The escrow model may not reflect future methodology enhancements by AIR which may have an adverse or beneficial effect on the implied rating of the notes were such future methodology considered.Fitch’s expected rating is based on a review of a draft Confidential Offering Circular Supplement No. 1 (dated March 24, 2015), a Rating Agency Presentation (dated March 24, 2015) and AIR Expert Risk Analysis and Results (dated March 25, 2015). The final rating is contingent upon receipt of signed legal documents pertinent to this transaction that do not materially change what has currently been reviewed. Any changes could lead Fitch to an alternative rating or inability to rate the note.Update 1:Thanks to ILS investor demand the single tranche of Cranberry Re Series 2015-1 Class A notes have upsized by 50%, to now offer $300m of risk to investors.Coupon price guidance for Cranberry Re launched with a range of 3.8% to 4.3%. Artemis understands that this has now been set to the bottom of the launch range, offering investors a 3.8% yield.With an expected loss of 1.377% on a base case (1.383% sensitivity case), the coupon of 3.8% will provide investors with a multiple of 2.8x (base case) or 2.7x (sensitivity case).Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Citrus Re Ltd. (Series 2015-1)","Citrus Re Ltd. (Series 2015-1)","Heritage Property and Casualty Insurance Co.","Willis Capital Markets & Advisory are sole structuring agent and bookrunner.","AIR Worldwide","U.S. named storms (Florida only initially)","$277.5m","Indemnity","NR","Apr 2015","In this new issuance Citrus Re Ltd., Heritage P&C’s Bermuda SPI, will seek to issue three tranches of Series 2015-1 notes to collateralize reinsurance agreements between itself and the insurer. The protection will run for three U.S. wind seasons, beginning in June 2015 and running to April 2018, sources said.At the moment the issuance is being marketed with a size of $150m which we understand from sources to be attributed to just the Class A notes at this time, with no size attributed to Class B or Class C. Whether that signals an ability to upsize this deal, or simply that the Class A note layer of protection is the priority is unclear.The protection afforded to Heritage P&C by this Citrus Re 2015-1 cat bond will be for Florida named storms initially, with an ability to update the covered area to include more states should the insurer choose, or expand into new states. The cat bond is structured with an indemnity trigger, providing protection on a per-occurrence basis.The Class A notes sit in a layer between Heritage P&C’s two 2014 Citrus Re cat bond, with an attachment point of $410m and an exhaustion point of $610m. While this tranche is currently marketed at $150m in size we understand that the hope is that it covers the full potential for losses within this layer, so Class A could grow to $200m it appears. If successful that would mean that the majority of the top of Heritage’s reinsurance tower would be covered using catastrophe bonds.Class B attaches at $336m with an exhaustion point high up at $986m, while Class C attach at $336m as well but with a lower exhaustion point at $536m. However we’re told the Class B notes have a reinsurance layer which inures to it, where as the Class C do not, which effectively makes C the highest risk tranche of the cat bond deal.In terms of probabilities and pricing the three tranches look as follows.Class A has an initial attachment probability on a base-case of 1.31%, an exhaustion probability of 1.14% and an expected loss of 1.22% (which rises to 1.41% using WSST sensitivity case). Artemis understands that the price guidance for the currently $150m of Class A notes is 4.25% to 5%.Class B has a base attachment probability of 4.01%, an exhaustion probability of 1.44% and an expected loss of 2.44% (2.79% on a WSST basis). This tranche is being offered to investors with a price guidance range of 6% to 6.25%.Class C has a base attachment probability of 6.23%, an exhaustion probability of 4.01% and an expected loss of 5.05% (5.64% on a WSST basis). The Class C notes are being offered with price guidance of 9% to 9.25%. Note again that the Class C notes may attach at the same level of losses as Class B, but they have no inuring reinsurance and so are riskier.From the way this cat bond has been structured it is possible that both the Class B and Class C notes may not survive, as it gives Heritage P&C a chance to test the market and investor appetite before perhaps pulling one or the other. We’ll have to see how the deal progresses to market.The Class B and Class C protection sits directly alongside Heritage P&C’s Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund coverage, we understand, which could mean that if these tranches are successfully issued the insurer could reduce its reliance on the FHCF (if it chose to).The transaction features a variable reset feature allowing the protection to be moved slightly, within defined boundaries of attachment and expected loss.Update 1:The Citrus Re Ltd. (Series 2015-1) catastrophe bond could close at $327.5m in size thanks to demand from investors, while pricing has moved to the mid and lower ends of guidance.The Class A tranche of notes launched at $150m in size, with an expected loss of 1.22% (which rises to 1.41% using WSST sensitivity case) and price guidance of 4.25% to 5%.At the latest deal update the Class A tranche is now being marketed as $150m to $200m in size and with price guidance narrowed towards the mid-point at 4.5% to 4.75%.The Class B notes have an expected loss of 2.44% (2.79% on a WSST basis) and was offered to investors with a price guidance range of 6% to 6.25%. We understand that this tranche is now sized at $97.5m and the price guidance has moved to the bottom of guidance at 6%.The Class C notes have an expected loss of 5.05% (5.64% on a WSST basis) and initial price guidance of 9% to 9.25%. This tranche is sized at $30m and the pricing has fallen to the bottom end of guidance at 9%.So if the cat bond completes with the Class A tranche at the upper size at $200m, with a $97.5m Class B tranche and a $30m Class C tranche, Heritage Insurance will have a $327.5m catastrophe bond sourced collateralized reinsurance cover.Update 2:The Class A tranche failed to upsize and completed at $150m. The pricing on Class A settled at the top of the adjusted range at 4.75%.Class B and Class C remained as at the last update, so $97.5m and $30m and with no change to the pricing.That made this Citrus Re 2015-1 catastrophe bond issue a total size of $277.5m for Heritage P&C.Update, November 1st 2017:Heritage’s catastrophe bonds look set to take some losses due to the impacts of hurricane Irma.Heritage announced a $388 million gross loss from the impact of hurricane Irma, which looks high enough to eat into the bottom of its catastrophe bond protection within its reinsurance tower.Sitting second from bottom of the cat bonds in its reinsurance tower, the $30 million tranche of Citrus Re 2015-1 Class C notes look likely to face a loss as they attach at $356 million of losses to the sponsor.The $30 million of Citrus Re 2015-1 Class C notes cover 15% of a layer of the reinsurance program, which means the loss to the tranche could be around a 16% loss of principal, which to noteholders could be around $5 million.Update, February 27th 2018:Heritage’s exposure to hurricane Irma has become a little clearer, after the insurer notified investors of its estimated amounts it can claim under this catastrophe bond.Heritage currently hopes to claim back $20 million of the $30 million of Citrus Re 2015-1 Class C notes.Update, April 12th 2018:Heritage has let the lowest risk Class A tranche of notes from this cat bond mature, but both the Class B and Class C have had their maturities extended to April 9th 2020, suggesting Heritage expects to make reinsurance recoveries from both of these tranches.Update, March 20th 2019:The $30 million Citrus Re Ltd. (Series 2015-1) Class C tranche of notes, which was the riskiest from this vintage of Citrus Re cat bonds having attached low down the reinsurance tower for Heritage (at around $356m of losses, we understand), has been allowed to mature with a balance of zero. As a result we assume this tranche, being the riskiest, has now paid our for sponsor Heritage.Update on losses/redemptions:For the latest details on potential losses for this bond please view our directory of catastrophe bond losses and cat bonds considered at-risk.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The understanding is that investors felt they were not being compensated sufficiently for the 7 year term. Reports suggest Allstate secured the protection in the traditional reinsurance market instead, although at what length of term remains uncertain.With Sanders Re Ltd. (Series 2015-1) Allstate is seeking $130m of protection, for itself and affiliates, over an extended 7-year term for the perils of U.S. named storms (excluding Florida), U.S. earthquake (CA, NY, SC, WA), volcanic eruption (excluding Florida) and meteorite impact (excluding Florida).The inclusion of volcanic eruption and meteorite impact is new, Allstate has not included them in its cat bonds before, showing that the insurer is watching what other primary insurers package into their deals (USAA and more recently Chubb).It is interesting that the insurer has excluded Florida from those perils, it has done so before for U.S. wind, particularly as a meteorite impact on Florida could potentially cause damage and losses across a much wider swathe of the United States. However the meteorite and volcanic risk is again a very low contribution to expected losses for the deal.The risk period of 7 years is perhaps the most telling factor, as Allstate seeks to lock in coverage over a longer term. The cat bond features redemption clauses, allowing Allstate to redeem the issued notes early for a premium, meaning that should the reinsurance and ILS market change dynamic again the insurer can close this deal down if better options emerge.The coverage provided by the Sanders Re 2015-1 Class C notes will be on a per-occurrence basis and the deal utilises a state-weighted PCS index of personal and auto losses, Artemis understands.The cat bond notes attach at an index level of $3.624 billion of losses and exhaust coverage at $4.07 billion. That equates to an initial base-case attachment probability of 1.08%, an exhaustion probability of 0.87% and an expected loss of 0.97%.In terms of pricing for the notes, sources said that it is being offered with a coupon range of 362.5 bps (3.625%) to 387.5 bps (3.875%). This is the first cat bond we can recall seeing priced down to a half a basis point, perhaps reflecting pricing moving less than in previous years as the market approaches a floor level, where every half a point gained counts. At the lowest end of that pricing range the coupon would work out to be a multiple of 3.7 times the base expected loss.The transaction features a variable reset, allowing Allstate to adjust the coverage provided slightly, no surprise given the long duration of the protection from this cat bond.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The notes will be exposed on a per-occurrence basis to U.S. hurricanes using an industry loss trigger and Australian cyclones using a modelled loss trigger.The triggers used are the same as previous Queen Street cat bonds, a county and line of business weighted PCS industry loss index for U.S. hurricanes and a postcode as well as line of business weighted modelled industry loss index for Australian cyclone risks.The 2015 Queen Street X Re cat bond issuance will afford Munich Re with protection for three U.S. hurricane and three Australian cyclone seasons, with the hurricane cover running to December 2017 and Australian cyclone to the end of May 2018.The covered area for U.S. hurricane risks is all exposed states, including Florida and some inland states where hurricanes may still cause major impacts as they move inland. Australian cyclone protection if for the entire Commonwealth we understand.In terms of attachment probability, the initial base probability is 3.47%, while the exhaustion probability is 1.89% and the expected loss 2.54% (2.72% on a WSST basis). Interestingly this cat bond is weighted towards the Australian cyclone risk, with that peril making up over 55% of the initial expected loss, we’re told.In fact the expected loss for the hurricane exposure is 1.05% initially, while the Australian cyclone peril is 1.51%. That’s a different mix to the previous Queen Street X Re attempted issue, hurricanes made a larger contribution to the expected loss of that deal which cyclone was around the same, suggesting perhaps that Munich Re sees an opportunity and need to better protect itself against Australian cyclone risks.The pricing for this transaction is launching with guidance of 5.5% to 6% above the collateral money market fund return. That would imply a multiple in the range of 2.1 to 2.4 times the expected loss on a base case.The Queen Street X Re cat bond from last year that failed to complete offered a multiple which at the mid-point would have been less than 2 times the expected loss. With the market having failed to be receptive to that transaction it looks like Munich Re is coming back with something much more attractive for investors and aligned with other cat bonds of late.Update 1:This cat bond priced at 5.75%, so right on the mid-point of guidance, which will provide investors a multiple of 2.25 times the base expected loss, or 2.11 times the sensitivity case.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Manatee Re Ltd. was registered in Bermuda in February for the purpose of issuing series of cat bond notes.With this first Series 2015-1 issuance, Manatee Re Ltd. will seek to issue a single Class A tranche of notes for the purposes of collateralizing a reinsurance contract between it and Safepoint Insurance Company, Artemis understands.The Manatee Re 2015-1 cat bond is targeting $75m of fully-collateralized reinsurance protection for the sponsor Safepoint, with the cover being for named storm risks (so tropical storms and hurricanes) initially within the state of Florida. This is the first Florida wind-only cat bond of 2015.The protection from the Manatee Re 2015-1 cat bond will be on an indemnity trigger and per occurrence basis. The cat bond cover will have a duration of just over 2 years and 8 months, with maturity scheduled for December 2017, we understand. That means it covers three full hurricane seasons for Safepoint.While the initial covered area is Florida only, we understand that Safepoint has baked terms into the cat bond deal that would allow it to expand it to other U.S. states after the first reset. This is a common practice for the Florida start-up insurers, many of whom have expansive strategies and plan to grow into new states as opportunities allow. Hence it makes sense to have the flexibility to expand the coverage a multi-year cat bond would provide them with.We understand that the cat bond would attach at a level of $120m of losses to Safepoint within the covered reinsurance layer and exhaust at $320m. That equates to an attachment probability of 1.36% on a base case and an exhaustion probability of 0.68%.That also means that should Safepoint find demand is high for its first catastrophe bond it could elect to upsize the deal significantly, to $200m, to cover that entire layer of its reinsurance programme.The initial expected loss meanwhile is set at 0.99%. Sources said the $75m of Manatee Re 2015-1 cat bond notes are being marketed to investors with price guidance showing a coupon in the range of 4.25% to 5%.On a multiple basis that is quite high, coming in at well over 4 times the expected loss and as much as 5 times if it priced at the upper end. Sources we discussed the issuance with suggested that this could be to give investors confidence in the start-up nature of Safepoint and its lean approach to running an insurance business (the Florida takeout insurers all tend to run a very lean ship). Another factor that could require a higher multiple is the fact that Safepoint will be looking to expand, into new lines and regions, so the covered portfolio could change we’d imagine.The deal features a variable reset, like so many other cat bonds, allowing the protection to be adjusted within the reinsurance tower as long as the attachment probability is kept within pre-defined bounds.Update 1:The Manatee Re 2015-1 catastrophe bond upsized by one-third to $100m before close.At the same time, the pricing was set at the upper end of the guidance, at 5%.The deal features a variable reset feature, but after a reset we understand that the coupon must remain within a range of 4.75% to 5.71%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Ltd.","Aon Benfield Securities are sole structuring agent and bookrunner","AIR Worldwide","Japan earthquake","$290m","Indemnity","?","Mar 2015","Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire is seeking to sponsor the issuance of a single tranche of cat bond notes through its Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurer Kizuna Re II Ltd. this year.Kizuna Re II Ltd. will issue a single tranche of Series 2015-1 Class A notes with a preliminary deal size of JPY25 billion (approximately $205m) to secure a fully-collateralized source of reinsurance protection for earthquake exposures including fire following across the whole of Japan over a four-year term, with four annual risk periods.Also included are any losses resulting from tsunamis or volcanic eruptions that are caused by an earthquake during the term of the cat bond and S&P noted that the volcanic eruption exposure is unmodelled. There’s an element of earthquake triggered flood risk in this cat bond too, with flood losses, including any caused by dam or levee rupture or sprinkler leakage, covered.Protection from the Class A notes will be on a per occurrence basis and the cat bond will feature an indemnity trigger. The notes will cover losses from Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire’s portfolio of personal, commercial and industrial property exposures across Japan.Standard & Poor’s explained more about the subject business:The covered exposures comprise commercial business that includes, but is not limited to, fire policies covering buildings used as shops and offices, as well as their contents; and industrial business that includes fire policies covering properties such as factories and warehouses, as well as their contents. Although the majority of policies fall within the category of fire policies, these two lines comprise policies categorized as fire, engineering, movable all risks, and business interruption policies (less than 30 policies have business interruption coverage) unless otherwise specified. Marine policies are not part of the covered exposures. Earthquake coverage for both property damage and business interruption is an endorsement to the standard contract earthquake endorsements that cover debris removal expenses (limited to 10% of the earthquake payout amount). The coverage includes fire policies and engineering and movable all risks policies. In all fire policies, earthquake fire expense insurance (EFEI) is covered in the standard contract. The modeled results indicate the majority of expected losses come from earthshake.Personal business consists of fire policies written on buildings used only for dwellings and household goods. Policy holders purchase earthquake coverage as a separate endorsement.For personal lines, all dwelling earthquake covers except for EFEI are ceded to Japan Earthquake Reinsurance Co. Ltd., the government-backed plan, and, therefore, are not reinsured under the reinsurance agreement. The covered exposures include policies in which TMNF is not the lead co-insurer. This accounts for less than 10% of earthquake total limit.The overwhelming contribution to expected loss is related to the commercial and industrial policies. The total insured value for commercial, industrial, and personal business fire policies are based on replacement value or actual cash value (estimated replacement value less depreciation of property). The majority of the policies are written on a replacement-value basis.We understand that the sponsor will retain a share of each loss of at least 10%, under the terms of the cat bond. The notes have an attachment point of JPY310 billion (approx. $2.5 billion) up to an exhaustion point of JPY350 billion (approx $2.9 billion), so covering a JPY40 billion (approx. $330m) reinsured layer of the sponsors programme.On the risk modelling side, since 1700, there have been two events–the 1923 Taisho Kanto quake with the epicenter in the Kanagawa prefecture (part of the greater Tokyo area) and the 1707 Hoei earthquake with the epicenter in the Wakayama prefecture–that would have triggered the bond.S&P explained; “The Hoei was the most powerful earthquake in Japan before 2011’s Tohoku earthquake, and it possibly caused an eruption of Mt. Fuji later that year. This 1923 event as modeled resulted in a 100% principal reduction. The modeled principal reductions from the 1707 event were modeled with (73% principle reduction) and without (68% principal reduction) the effect from the tsunami.”Importantly, the number of historical earthquake events that could have impacted this cat bond does not increase if the 0.07% increased expected loss figure is used.It’s also worth noting that the 2011 Tohoku earthquake would not have come anywhere near attaching the Kizuna Re II 2015-1 cat bond notes, as its ultimate net loss would only have been ¥95 billion and the attachment point is ¥310 billion.This is a very remote risk Japan quake cat bond. The initial modelled attachment probability is said to be just 0.021%, while the exhaustion probability is 0.016% and the expected loss 0.018%.The least risky layer of last years Kizuna Re II 2014-1 catastrophe bond had an attachment probability of 0.41% and an expected loss of 0.21%, so were considerably riskier than this new tranche which is being issued.In terms of pricing guidance, we understand that the Kizuna Re II 2015-1 Class A notes are being offered to investors with coupon guidance of 2% above the return of the underlying investments. We’re told that there is no range being offered, which suggests that the deal will likely just close at a 2% coupon.The 2014 Kizuna Re II deal priced the least risky tranche of notes at 2.25%. But if you compare the multiples, the 2015 deal will have a very high multiple, given the very low expected loss number, so investors are getting compensated more in terms of multiple to coupon.This 2015 cat bond features a variable reset, we understand, but even if the sponsor chose to move the layer to the riskiest it is allowed under the terms of the deal it would still be a much more remote risk than its 2014 deal.The collateral assets for this cat bond are being invested in Japanese Yen denominated investment funds, we understand, the first time this has been the case for a Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire cat bond we believe.Standard & Poor’s has assigned an investment grade rating to a catastrophe bond for the first time since 2008, as the remote risk nature of the underlying Japanese earthquake risk helped the Kizuna Re II 2015-1 cat bond to a ‘BBB- (sf)’ preliminary rating assessment.S&P explained; “This is the first property related nat-cat bond we’ve assigned an investment grade rating to since 2008.”Gary Martucci, Director of Financial Services Ratings at S&P, explained some the reasoning behind the rating to Artemis; “TMNF’s market share offset some of the stress typically applied to a transaction where the cedent has a much smaller market share since their losses will more likely mirror the industry. In addition, given TMNF’s market share, by looking to the highest probability of attachment based on the variable reset, we believe there’s a significant amount of conservativism captured.”Martucci went into more detail on the preliminary rating of these notes, saying; “To assign the nat-cat risk factor, we applied an adjustment to the time-dependent and time-independent results to reflect the possibility that the probability of attachment may be greater than the models had anticipated.“Typically, we use the more conservative of these results, but there was a large difference between the two in this particular transaction. In year 1, there was more than a 10-fold increase in the estimated probability of attachment by moving from time-dependent to time-independent modeling, 2.1 bps versus 21.4 bps. This large difference seems to result at least in part from the recent Tohoku earthquake. The time-dependent result is lower because such an event decreases the amount of stress on a fault, making subsequent events less likely.”An interesting point on this deal from S&P’s pre-sale report is the fact that the underlying portfolio can change, effectively raising the expected loss, but the coupon will remain the same.S&P explains; “This issuance is structured to keep the attachment and exhaustion points constant, so, as exposures change, the probability of attachment, exhaustion, and the modeled loss will increase and decrease, subject to a maximum expected loss of seven basis points (bps). The interest spread will remain constant.”However with this being such a remote risk transaction and with the deal likely to have a huge multiple investors are still being compensated for this additional uncertainty while the sponsor will benefit from additional flexibility in the structure as its portfolio changes.S&P explained further:AIR did the modeling using TMNF’s exposures as of March 31, 2014, and AIR’s time-dependent catalog. The probability of attachment, expected loss, and probability of exhaustion based on this catalog were 0.021%, 0.018%, and 0.016%, respectively.When rating catastrophe bonds linked to earthquakes, we look at both time-dependent and time-independent analyses, and usually use the more conservative of the two. The time-independent analysis probability of attachment is 0.214%. The time-independent expected loss and exhaustion probabilities are 0.194% and 0.181%, respectively.This issuance is structured to keep the attachment and exhaustion points constant, so, as exposures change, the probability of attachment, exhaustion, and the modeled loss will increase and decrease, subject to a maximum expected loss of seven basis points (bps). The interest spread will remain constant.When rating nat-cat bonds that permit variable resets, we look to the highest probability of attachment permitted, which is based on the modeled annual expected loss cap of seven basis points (bps). Based on the time-dependent occurrence exceedance probability (OEP) curve, if the expected loss is seven bps, the attachment point would be ¥238.6 billion and the probability of attachment 10.5 bps. Based on the time-independent catalog, the probability of attachment and expected loss would be 35.5 bps and 30.5 bps, respectively. Our analysis for the second through fourth risk periods assumes the expected loss for each reset to be seven bps. We then stress the results to determine the nat-cat risk factor.To assign the nat-cat risk factor, we applied an adjustment to the time-dependent and time-independent results to reflect the possibility that the probability of attachment may be greater than the models had anticipated. Typically, we use the more conservative of these results, but there was a large difference between the two in this particular transaction. In year 1, there was more than a 10-fold increase in the estimated probability of attachment (POA) by moving from time-dependent to time-independent modeling (2.1 bps versus 21.4 bps). This large difference seems to result at least in part from the recent Tohoku earthquake. The time-dependent result is lower because such an event decreases the amount of stress on a fault, making subsequent events less likely.The stress factor that we applied to determine nat-cat risk factor reflected a number of factors. Our criteria list indicative stress levels for varying transactions with industry loss transactions having a 10% stress and indemnity transactions a 20% stress. Although losses for this transaction are calculated on an indemnity basis, TMNF’s large market share in some ways makes it more similar to an industry loss transaction. We would not expect a carrier of its size to have losses that greatly differ from its proportional share of the market’s losses. We also considered that the transaction contains some small amount of unmodeled risks and the transaction had a variable reset feature that we were treating very conservatively by looking to the highest probability.We then select the next rating category below this adjusted POA that’s greater than or equal to the adjusted probability of attachment from our nat-cat risk factor table. This adjustment results in varying margins between the initial parameter values needed to trigger a payment from the noteholders to the issuer under the reinsurance agreement and the parameter values at the probability of attachment commensurate with the assigned rating.Update 1:The Kizuna Re II 2015-1 catastrophe bond was upsized by 40% thanks to strong demand from investors. The offering size grew to JPY 35 billion, which is approximately $290m.Update March 2016:The four-year term Japanese earthquake cat bond was the first to see its collateral assets invested in a Japanese Yen denominated investment fund and that fund is now to be liquidated. Which raises the possibility of this being due to the recent shift to negative interest rates at the central bank of Japan or to potential tax obligations or costs in moving to another permitted investment fund.The notes are being redeemed under an early redemption event number VI. Standard & Poor’s describes this as permitting:“The cedent to terminate the reinsurance agreement and redeem the deal early if it believes the supplemental premium payments (the annual service provider expenses) or a fee charged or imposed on any cash credit balance in the JPY deposit account or collateral account is likely (in TMNF’s sole discretion) to exceed $750,000 in a risk period or $2 million during the term of the transaction.”According to rating agency Standard & Poor’s the collateral fund, the JPMorgan JPY Cash Liquidity Fund, is to be liquidated by its manager JPMorgan Asset Management on the 11th March 2016 and proceeds from that fund, including the collateral from this cat bond, will be disbursed to investors on 14th March.The funds in the Kizuna Re II 2015’s cat bond collateral account will be held in cash during the period between liquidation and disbursement, S&P explained.The Kizuna Re II cat bond transaction featured six possible redemption event options, and the fact that the sponsor has elected to do so under this particular redemption clause is due to the collateral account and this fund liquidation, with the negative Japanese interest rate one possible cause.S&P explained that this particular redemption event has no early redemption payment associated with it, so the sponsor, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co. Ltd., will not need to compensate investors in the Kizuna Re II notes for the termination of the deal, they will simply receive their principal back.So it’s possible that the fund is being liquidated due to an inability to meet investment return targets due to the negative interest rate situation in Japan, with this affecting the cat bond. Or there could have been cost or tax implications associated with the liquidation and moving to another fund.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Merna Re Ltd. (Series 2015-1)","Merna Re Ltd. (Series 2015-1)","State Farm","Aon Benfield Securities is sole structuring agent and bookrunner","RMS","U.S. earthquake (New Madrid region)","$300m","Indemnity","?","Mar 2015","State Farm has registered a new special purpose insurer in Bermuda for the purposes of this cat bond issue, stepping away from its more typical numbering of cat bonds with a vehicle simply named Merna Re Ltd.We understand from sources that the Merna Re 2015-1 catastrophe bond will sit alongside the 2014 issued Merna Re V Ltd., so providing a good comparison on pricing and terms. That deal offered the lowest quake coupon yield ever, but it looks like State Farm wants to take advantage of ILS investor appetite and attractive market pricing to push this even lower in 2015.For its latest cat bond, State Farm is seeking a three-year source of fully-collateralized reinsurance protection against New Madrid earthquake losses. The deal will see Merna Re Ltd. issuing a single tranche of Series 2015-1 Class A notes, which has a preliminary size of $300m.The protection afforded by the Merna Re 2015-1 cat bond will be on a per occurrence basis and the cat bond features an indemnity trigger. Coverage is for the same region as its 2014 cat bond we understand. The cat bond will cover losses from earthquakes (including fire following) suffered in Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin, which are the U.S. states situated around the New Madrid earthquake fault.We understand that for launch the Merna Re 2015-1 cat bond will have the same risk profile as the Merna Re V deal from 2014, with an attachment probability of 0.56%, an exhaustion probability of 0.32% and an expected loss of 0.41%. That puts the attachment point at $450m of losses to State Farm, covering a layer up to $1.45 billion.However, the 2015 Merna Re cat bond features a flexible reset which will allow State Farm to adjust the coverage if it desires up to an expected loss of 0.56%. That flexibility will allow the risk level to be increased in the cat bond which would trigger a higher coupon for investors, as the coupon would be adjusted in line with any increase in expected loss.We’re told that the single tranche of $300m Class A notes to be issued by Merna Re in this 2015-1 cat bond are being marketed to investors with price guidance of 1.75% to 2%.The Merna Re V cat bond, which covers the same risks on the same terms and at the same attachment point, priced in 2014 at the bottom of a 2% to 2.5% initial range. So State Farm is looking to secure a discount in 2015 with lower pricing if possible, but the range suggests it would be okay with achieving the same pricing as last year.When looking at the potential multiple of expected loss to coupon however the deal looks to provide reasonable value. With so many cat bonds pricing at levels that indicate multiples of 2 to 2.5 times expected losses, the Merna Re 2015-1 cat bond could result in a multiple of 4.3 times even at the bottom end of that price guidance range.New Madrid quakes are considered very remote risks and as a result the risk model results indicate low pricing for a low-frequency, although potentially high severity, catastrophe event. As a result New Madrid earthquake risk can be priced much lower than other peak earthquake zones around the world.However this is a very remote risk catastrophe bond, with the attachment probability of 0.56% which naturally also drives the lower pricing expectation.Update 1:The $300m tranche of notes now looks set to price at the top end of the initial coupon guidance, at 2%. Perhaps another reflection of where investors pricing floor may be for peak catastrophe risks.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Citigroup and Deutsche Bank are joint bookrunners. Willis Capital Markets & Advisory is co-manager.","RMS","U.S. named storms, earthquakes, severe thunderstorms, winter storms, wildfires, volcanic eruption, meteorite impact","$250m","Indemnity","S&P: 'BB(sf)'","Mar 2015","With this East Lane Re VI 2015-1 cat bond Chubb is seeking a new multi-year source of fully-collateralized reinsurance protection against multiple U.S. perils. The transaction will see a single Class A tranche of notes issued with a preliminary size of $225m, according to market sources.As with all Chubb East Lane catastrophe bonds the ultimate beneficiaries of the protection provided will be a range of Chubb insurer subsidiaries, named as: Federal Insurance Co., Vigilant Insurance Co., Chubb Insurance Co. of New Jersey, Chubb National Insurance Co., Chubb Indemnity Insurance Co., Great Northern Insurance Co., Pacific Indemnity Co., Executive Risk Indemnity Inc., Executive Risk Specialty Insurance Co., Chubb Custom Insurance Co., Texas Pacific Indemnity Co., and Chubb Lloyds Insurance Co. of Texas.The cover from this East Lane Re VI 2015-1 cat bond will be on an indemnity and per-occurrence basis.The protection provided by the 2015-1 Chubb cat bond will be for the typical cat bond perils of U.S. named storms, earthquakes, severe thunderstorms, winter storms and wildfires as well as the first time included meteorite impact and volcanic eruption risks.S&P notes that the East Lane Re VI 2015-1 cat bond issue will cover losses in the covered area due to named storms, earthquakes (including fire following and sprinkler leakage, losses related to which are included in the modeling), severe thunderstorms, winter storms, wildfire, volcanic eruption and meteorite impact on a per-occurrence basis.RMS is the third-party risk modelling firm assigned to the transaction, however the firm does not have a risk model for northeastern U.S. wildfire, meteorite impacts or volcanic eruptions, S&P explains.S&P says that when assigning the preliminary rating, the impact from wildfire, volcanic eruption, and meteorite impact had a minimal effect. S&P explained that the total adjustment to the probability of attachment due to these unmodelled perils is 2 basis points. S&P said that it does not anticipate any of these perils to result in losses that would reach the cat bond’s attachment point, however there is some minimal risk.On each of the unmodelled perils S&P explains its thinking in the deal pre-sale report:For wildfire, prolonged periods without precipitation in the covered area are not typical. In addition, given the locations of the exposures, there is significant access to fire-fighting resources. Furthermore, the insured losses from the largest Western wildfires would not reach the attachment point.In terms of volcanic eruptions, there are no active calderas that RMS believes pose a threat to the covered area. (There are two volcanoes in New Hampshire, but these are considered inactive.) We also took into account a report from the U.S. Geological Survey indicating that volcanic activity can trigger earthquakes under some circumstances and that earthquakes can trigger volcanic activity as well, though the latter relationship is less well understood; typically, the resulting event is of a smaller magnitude.Regarding meteorite impacts, our sources consider the 1908 impact in Tunguska, Siberia, to be a 1-in-1000-year event. In February 2013, a large asteroid exploded above the Russian city of Chelyabinsk. The object’s air burst injured approximately 1,500 people and damaged more than 7,200 buildings valued in excess of $30 million. According to our sources, this is the largest known object to have entered the Earth’s atmosphere since the 1908 Tunguska event.S&P highlights the unmodelled nature of these perils as one of the items of concern that it always notes about every cat bond deal it rates in the pre-sale report. However the rating agency explains; “The exposures that were not modeled are primarily exposures under commercial property and package forms that fall under a bundle of additional coverages, subject to a sub-limit, typically $500,000. Exposures in excess of $500,000 were included in the modeling.”The risk period for the transaction will be five years, to March 2020, showing that Chubb is seeking to take advantage of broader coverage now available from cat bonds, and investors willingness to allow insurers to lock in longer-term reinsurance coverage.The covered area for the deal is Chubb’s insurance heartland states of Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia.We understand that the initial attachment probability for the notes is set at 1.35%, with exhaustion at 1.14% and the expected loss at 1.24%. We’re told that this equates to a $2.1 billion indemnity trigger attachment point and a $2.45 billion exhaustion. That $350m gap between attachment and exhaustion points could hint at the ultimate size of the transaction, should Chubb elect to upsize it.Property Claim Services (PCS) is being used for catastrophe designation on a number of the covered perils we understand, thus ensuring that only events of a certain magnitude and with a third-party agent designating them as catastrophes would qualify.Other concerns S&P notes include the fact that 41.4% of the expected losses are due to commercial exposures, the fact that there is the potential for significant losses due to flood and storm surge and that the initial stated reinsurance could be eroded by covered events.On the initial stated reinsurance, S&P explains; “The probability of attachment would be 4 basis points higher without the application of the initial stated reinsurance, and given the covered area, we typically do not experience more than one covered event within a year.”Covered losses are for both personal and commercial lines of insurance property exposures. S&P notes that Chubb primarily markets its personal lines policies to high-net-worth individuals and is well-known for insuring high-value homes, auto, and other properties.Named storm and hurricane risks are the major exposure with this deal, contributing 89.4% of the expected losses. Personal lines exposure makes up 58.6% of the expected loss. Due to the northeast U.S. focus of Chubb’s book of business New York makes up 40.6% of the expected losses by state, followed by Connecticut, New Jersey and Massachusetts. Around half of the total insurable value of the covered portfolio consists of coverage for professional, technical and business services.The East Lane Re VI 2015-1 catastrophe bond features a variable reset feature, which S&P explains in more detail:When rating nat-cat bonds that permit variable resets, we look to the highest probability of attachment permitted. At each annual reset, the expected loss can be reset within a range of 1.00%-1.50%. As a secondary reset limit, the probability of attachment cannot exceed 1.90%. Based on the current occurrence exceedence probability curve, if the expected loss were 1.50% (using the long-term rate for hurricanes), the probability of attachment would be 1.65%. The preliminary rating assumes the expected loss for each reset to be 1.50%. We do not expect the shape of the curve to change significantly, so we considered 1.65% to be the reset probability of attachment. We then looked to the related medium-term rate probability of attachment to be 1.78%. To determine the reset probability of attachment, we stressed the results and based the nat-cat risk factor off these results.Pricing wise, the notes are being offered with coupon guidance of 3.5% to 4%, we understand, which with an expected loss of 1.24% should see a multiple well above 2.Given where this East Lane Re VI 2015-1 catastrophe bond is set to attach, it is more risky than last years East Lane Re VI Ltd. (Series 2014-1) which attaches at $3 billion of losses to Chubb and has an expected loss of 0.82%. That deal priced at 2.75%, so the multiple looks almost aligned.Update:Chubb’s latest cat bond looked set to upsize, as sources suggested a range of $225m to $250m for the single tranche of notes. At the same time the coupon price guidance was narrowed from the initial 3.5% to 4% to 3.5% to 3.75%.In the end Chubb upsized the deal and the East Lane Re VI cat bond will complete at $250m in size. The pricing however did not continue downwards and has settled at 3.75%, the upper end of the narrowed range or the mid-point of the deal’s launch coupon guidance.In the case of this cat bond, with pricing of 3.75% and an expected loss of 1.24%, investors have secured a multiple of 3X.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The trigger for each peril will be based on PCS reported county or province weighted industry losses, we’re told.Named storm coverage is across 29 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and the District of Colombia, while earthquake coverage is across the U.S., DC and Canada.The notes have an index attachment point of 650 points, but with a deductible of 45 index points per event. The exhaustion point is at an index level of 850, sources said. We understand that equates to an initial attachment probability of 4.16%, exhaustion probability of 2.84% and expected loss of 3.43%.In terms of pricing, the single tranche of notes are being marketed to investors with a guidance range of 7% to 7.75% we’re told. So that looks like a multiple of at least 2 times the expected loss even at the low-end of guidance.The notes feature a variable reset facility, as so many cat bonds do nowadays, which could allow SCOR to increase the expected loss to provide more cover, but with investors compensated accordingly with a higher coupon.Interestingly, the collateral from the sale of the notes to ILS investors will be invested in EBRD notes, a collateral type which has not been so popular in recent years. The fear of negative rates is of course rife in the Eurozone, but we understand the deal will set a minimum interest of zero so a negative collateral return would not be possible even if rates in Europe declined further.Update:The single tranche of Series 2015-1 Class A notes remains sized at $150m. However the pricing guidance has been narrowed at the low-end of initial guidance with the initial 7% to 7.75% coupon range now tightened to 7% to 7.25%.Update 2:The $150m of Series 2015-1 Class A notes being issued by Atlas IX Capital have priced at the lowest end of guidance, at 7%. So resulting in a multiple at market of just slightly over 2 times the expected loss of 3.43%.Update – July 2019:The still rising losses from some of 2017’s U.S. hurricanes have tipped the Atlas IX Capital Series 2015-1 catastrophe bond notes into loss, resulting in a retrocessional reinsurance recovery for sponsor SCOR.We’re told that the aggregate losses across 2017’s hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria have now surpassed the trigger point for the notes, meaning SCOR is due a payment from the outstanding principal.In particular it is the loss creep from hurricane Irma that we understand took the notes over the attachment point.The cat bond features an industry loss trigger, based on reporting by PCS. The Irma loss has been the one developing the most in recent months, so is likely the one that resulted in this payment coming due.We understand that the index attachment point had been set at 850 index points in the aggregate for the 2017 risk period. The aggregate index level of the qualifying losses was raised to almost 885 in June, so triggering the cat bond.As a result of this, we’re told that a recovery of almost $26 million is now due to SCOR, $25.913 million to be more precise.Interestingly though, while hurricane Irma is likely to have been the specific event to tip the cat bond into loss, the majority of the aggregated loss index points actually came from hurricane Maria, we’re told.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurance vehicle and fifth cat bond in total, the re/insurer is seeking fully-collateralized protection for a much higher risk layer of its reinsurance program than before.In this issuance Galileo Re Ltd. is seeking to issue a single tranche of Series 2015-1 Class A notes, which will be sold to investors to provide a multi-year source of fully-collateralized reinsurance protection against certain U.S. named storm, U.S. and Canada earthquake and European windstorm risks (the same perils as the 2013 Galileo Re deal).The notes will have a 3 year risk-period, maturing at December 31st 2017. All three of the covered perils will be covered on an annual aggregate basis and the triggers used are weighted industry loss index triggers, with PCS providing the index data for U.S. wind and quake and PERILS AG for European windstorm events.U.S. named storm, so tropical storm, hurricane and post-tropical, coverage is for the typical U.S. east and gulf coast states and Florida, but also for some inland states where a degrading major storm could still have a major impact. U.S. quake is for the entire 50 states, BC and Canada. European windstorm cover is for the UK, Ireland, Germany, Belgium, France, Denmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and Switzerland.We’re told that the weighted index attachment point for the Series 2015-1 Class A notes issued by Galileo Re will be $160m, while the exhaustion will be at an index value equivalent of $480m. That gap of $320m between attachment and exhaustion may hint at an ability to upsize this cat bond if Catlin chooses.The notes have an initial attachment probability of 15.33%, showing just how high risk this transaction is.The initial expected loss is 7.93%, which would be in the top ten highest EL figures Artemis has recorded, while the initial exhaustion probability is 3.94%.Artemis understands that the notes are being offered to investors with price guidance of 13.5% to 14%.Update:The Galileo Re 2015 catastrophe bond upsized by 50% to close securing $300m of reinsurance coverage for Catlin.The pricing on the Galileo Re cat bond’s $300m of notes settled at the lowest end of guidance, according to sources, at 13.5%.In terms of a multiple, investors will be getting paid just 1.7 times the expected loss, which is a particularly low multiple perhaps reflecting the strong appetite for a higher-yielding bond.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Part of the proceeds have been used to redeem the Vecta I Ltd. notes, perhaps due to the new transaction providing a more efficient and cheaper source of capital. The remainder of the proceeds are to be used for general corporate purposes.“This transaction further extends and diversifies Aurigen’s capital structure”, said Alan Ryder, President and CEO of Aurigen Capital Limited. “The transaction demonstrates Aurigen’s leadership, innovation and access to the capital markets. Its creative structure enables ongoing access to capital funding to continue the development of our business.”The life ILS issuance was sponsored by Aurigen Reinsurance Limited (ARL) and covers a closed block of Canadian life insurance policies reinsured by ARL between 2008 and 2013. ARL enters into a retrocession agreement with Valins I Limited, which then issues and sells the notes to fund it.The Valins I notes are linked to the future profits of the subject business, which consists of twenty-six life reinsurance treaties underwritten by Aurigen Reinsurance Company, an affiliate, from twelve cedent life insurance companies. So if the subject business does not perform principal repayment can be cut, which effectively means that the notes main risk is linked to the mortality experience of the block of closed life business, although policy lapse risk is also involved.The transaction benefits Aurigen by allowing it to securitize the mortality and lapse risk associated with the defined block of reinsured life policies as well as being able to monetise the cash flows associated with life insurance and mortality business upfront.The Valins I Limited notes have a 6-year term and offer the investors a floating rate coupon set at three month CDOR plus 3.65%. The offering structure differs a little to the previous Vecta I deal, by allowing for the issuance to be increased and the notes to be extended, which provides Aurigen with additional flexibility to add future new business to the structure and provides continuous access to capital funding to support its growth.The Valins I Limited transaction was issued with the help of BNP Paribas who acted as structuring and placement agent, while Oliver Wyman provided independent third-party risk analysis.The Valins I Limited Notes have been offered as a Private Placement and have not been rated.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The series of transactions protect Aetna on a reinsurance basis against sudden rises in health insurance medical benefit claims and the insurer has effectively been using them as a capital tool, freeing up capital while also acquiring protection against unexpected or sharp increases in claims.The two tranches of protection provided by Aetna’s Vitality Re III deal, which gave the health insurer $150m of cover, both matured this week. So the Vitality Re VI deal will replace some of that protection but also increase Aetna’s use of ILS as this deal is targeting $200m between the two tranches of notes that are being issued, according to sources.In this deal Vitality Re VI Ltd. will seek to issue and sell to investors two tranches of Series 2015-1 health insurance medical benefit risk linked notes. A Class A tranche has a preliminary size of $140m while the Class B tranche has a preliminary size of $60m. Both tranches are linked to Aetna’s medical benefit ratio as a trigger.As with Aetna’s other Vitality ILS deals, it uses its Health Re captive type reinsurer to enter into excess of loss reinsurance agreements with the Vitality Re VI vehicle. The sale of the notes collateralizes the reinsurance agreements, providing Aetna with a multi-year source of fully-collateralized protection. The deal will mature at the end of 2017, thus providing Aetna with three years of annual aggregate coverage.The notes are at risk of Aetna’s medical benefit claims ratio exceeding pre-defined attachment points during each annual risk period. Claims can accrue during the year towards these attachments, but are then reset at the end of the each year. As such the protection provided is annual aggregate reinsurance and is, despite being based on medical benefit ratio claims, is effectively an indemnity cover.Artemis understands that the $140m Class A tranche of notes attach at 100% of the medical benefit ratio and exhaust at 114%, while the Class B notes are riskier, attaching at 94% MBR up to 100%. So the Class B notes sit beneath the Class A and would be triggered first. Compared to other in-force Vitality transactions, the Vitality Re VI deal trigger is set lower than the Vitality re IV or V deals, so this is a slightly higher risk issuance.However these are very remote in terms of the actual risk, as it would take a major health related event to raise Aetna’s MBR so high as to trigger the notes. In fact the expected loss of these notes is explained as 1 basis point for the Class A notes and 24 basis points for Class B, that can be thought of as 0.01% and 0.24%, so very remote risk compared to the more typical catastrophe bond ILS deals. The attachment probabilities are explained as 6 basis points for Class A and 62 basis points for Class B (again akin to 0.06% and 0.62%).In terms of coupon price guidance, we’re told that the Class A notes are being marketed with a range of 1.65% to 2.15%, while the riskier Class B notes are marketed at 2.25% to 2.75%.Update:The $140m Class A tranche of notes will pay investors a coupon of 1.75%, so below the mid-point but not quite at the bottom of guidance.The Class B notes meanwhile have seen the price drop below the guidance range, settling at 2.1%.The deal completed at the targeted $200m in size.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The CHF 70m of ILS notes are due for maturity on the 15th January 2015.The segregated account, “Leine Re”, was set up on the 19th November 2014, for the purpose of issuing the Notes and entering into a retrocession agreement with Hannover Re, a Trust Deed and other related agreements and activities.It’s possible that the Leine Re notes cover a renewal deal with the protection beginning on the 1st January and running for one year, given the notes due date of 15th Jan 2016, however again we cannot confirm.Update 1:The recent CHF 70m ($71m) Leine Re private catastrophe bond transaction, which was issued through Hannover Re’s Kaith Re Ltd. segregated accounts company, was ultimately ceded by and benefits Swiss canton insurer Gebäudeversicherung Bern (GVB).A press release from Guy Carpenter’s capital markets arm, GC Securities, which acted as the sole placement for the issuance of the Leine Re private cat bond, reveals some new information including the fact that Swiss insurer GVB is ultimately the beneficiary of the protection the cat bond provides.GVB is a private property insurer established by law to provide mandatory insurance coverage against fire and weather-related damage for all buildings in the canton of Bern. The completion of the Leine Re private cat bond is the first time that the insurer has used the cat bond market to manage its risks.The notes issued by Kaith Re Ltd., through its segregated account Leine Re, have been placed under Regulation S as Principal At-Risk Variable Rate Notes, with a due date of January 15, 2016. The notes have a notional principal at CHF70,000,000 and this is the first ever Swiss franc-denominated catastrophe bond to be issued.Kaith Re is a Bermuda exempted company registered as a Class 3 insurer and a segregated account company owned by German reinsurer Hannover Re. Kaith Re Ltd. is increasingly being used for facilitating private catastrophe bond issuance and risk transformation for ILS deals as Hannover Re positions itself as one of the leading ILS facilitators.In the case of the Leine Re private cat bond, Kaith Re acted on behalf of the segregated account Leine Re to issue the notes and ultimately provide capital markets protection to GVB via the Swiss Franc-Denominated Private Catastrophe Bond (“Gurten”).The private cat bond’s protection is positioned alongside traditional reinsurance cover on each layer of GVB’s traditional reinsurance program. The transaction provides one year of annual aggregate cover to GVB on identical coverage terms to its traditional reinsurance program terms.Interestingly, the deal involved two of the world’s leading ILS managers from Switzerland, LGTILS Partners Ltd. and Schroders Investment Management [Switzerland] AG. These key investors were involved early in the issuance process, which streamlined the implementation of the cat bond.The end result was to efficiently provide GVB with a source of capital markets-backed reinsurance protection covering Swiss natural peril catastrophe risk, which GC Securities said is “highly competitive” compared to its traditional reinsurance placement.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

As is typical, Nakama Re Ltd. will issue the two tranches of Series 2014-2 notes to fully-collateralize two underlying reinsurance contracts with Zenkyoren. Both tranches provide reinsurance protection on an ultimate net loss, or indemnity, triggered basis and coverage is for losses from earthquake shaking, tidal wave, flood, fire following and also sprinkler damage, we hear.A Class 1 tranche of notes will provide Zenkyoren with earthquake reinsurance protection in Japan on a per-occurrence basis across a four year period. This tranche provides protection over a JPY 200 billion layer of Zenkyoren’s reinsurance program, from an attachment point of JPY 1.95 trillion to an exhaustion point at JPY 2.15 trillion of losses. That equates to an attachment probability of 0.63% and expected loss of 0.58%.The other Class 2 tranche will provide protection on a three-year aggregate basis, across each of three overlapping risk periods over five full years in total. The Class 2 tranche is unusual for that reason, as it effectively has three three-year risk periods that each overlap, meaning that it effectively offers nine years of protection if each risk period is considered discreet of the others, although running in tandem at times.The more complicated Class 2 tranche attaches at JPY 1.85 trillion to an exhaustion point at JPY 2.05 trillion, so again covering a JPY 200 billion layer. With protection being on a three-year aggregate basis, this tranche has a three-year attachment probability of 2.35%, which on an annual basis equates to 0.78%. The three-year expected loss is 2.09%, which is 0.70% on an annual basis. This tranche’s layer also features a franchise deductible of JPY 270 billion.In terms of pricing, the per-occurence Class 1 notes are marketed with guidance of 2% to 2.25%, we understand, while the three-year aggregate Class 2 notes are marketed with guidance of 2.75% to 3%.*Update 1:*After two weeks of marketing to the ILS investor community, both tranches have increased in size. The Class 1 per-occurrence tranche of notes has increased in size by 75% to $175m, while the Class 2 aggregate tranche of notes has doubled in size to $200m, giving the cat bond a total expected size of $375m.At the same time as upsizing the pricing has moved while the deal was marketed to investors, with both tranches looking set to price at the mid-point of the initial price guidance.The per-occurrence Class 1 notes launched with coupon guidance of 2% to 2.25%, which we understand has now moved to the mid-point at 2.125%. Meanwhile, the three-year aggregate Class 2 notes which launched with guidance of 2.75% to 3%, look likely to also price at the mid-point at 2.875%.*Update 2:*At final pricing the Nakama Re 2014-2 catastrophe bond remained at $375m in size, while the pricing stayed at the revised coupon levels of 2.125% for the Class 1 notes and 2.875% for the Class 2 notes.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2014-1) AIG is seeking at least $300m of fully-collateralized reinsurance protection, through the issuance of three tranches of cat bond notes, Artemis understands. All three tranches of notes will provide AIG with reinsurance cover on an indemnity and per-occurrence basis, with two tranches providing their cover over a three-year risk period, while one has a one-year risk period.The coverage is for similar perils as the previous Tradewynd Re cat bonds. Named storms (so tropical storms and hurricanes) are covered across the U.S., Canada, Mexico, most of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and the District of Colombia. Earthquake risks are covered across the U.S., Canada, Mexico, most of the Caribbean and the District of Colombia.Two of the Series 2014-1 tranches of notes being issued by Tradewynd Re are riskier than those issued in the previous deals, sitting below them in AIG’s reinsurance tower, we understand. The third tranche will sit alongside the other Tradewynd deals, but with a drop-down feature allowing the coverage to move down a layer should the cat bond tranches beneath be exhausted.A Class 1-B tranche of notes will sit at the lower level, below the older Tradewynd cat bonds and are the tranche with a one-year risk period through 2015. This tranche, as yet unsized we understand, has an attachment probability of 3.35%, an exhaustion probability of 1.43% and an expected loss of 2.2%. These notes attach at $3 billion of qualifying losses to AIG up to $4.5 billion.A Class 3-A tranche of notes, with a three-year risk period, sits at the same level of the older Tradewynd cat bonds. This tranche attaches at $4.5 billion of losses to AIG up to $5.5 billion, but has a drop-down feature allowing them to move down to a $3 billion attachment point. The probability of attachment is 1.43%, the exhaustion probability is 0.91% and the expected loss is 1.14%.The final tranche, Class 3-B, sits at the same level as Class 1-B but beneath 3-A, making this the tranche that if eroded would see the 3-B tranche drop down to replace it, we understand. These notes attach at $3 billion of losses up to $4.5 billion, with an attachment probability of 3.35%, an exhaustion probability of 1.43% and an expected loss of 2.2%. These notes have a three-year risk period as well.So, the one year tranche seems almost an extension of the cover provided by the Class 3-B notes for the first year, but with the Class 3-B notes being replaceable by the Class 3-A should they be eroded as well. This will give AIG more first-year cover across the lower level of its programme, at $3 billion of losses to the insurer, while the drop-down could then be activated should that all be exhausted.As with its other Tradewynd Re catastrophe bonds, AIG is seeking cover for a diverse portfolio of underlying risks again with this deal. We understand that as with the previous Tradewynd’s this 2014-1 cat bond will cover both personal lines consumer insurance policies as well as commercial insurance lines of business.The commercial book contains such covered business lines as commercial property, energy, marine and engineering risks. As with previous Tradewynd’s, note the clever inclusion of energy risks with coverage of the Gulf of Mexico for hurricanes. The personal coverage covers lines of business such as residential coverage, high net worth personal lines, auto physical damage, yacht and fine art and collections and excess and surplus business.With its Tradewynd Re cat bonds AIG is sensibly covering large portions of its book, likely in areas that the firm is seeking growth as well, using capital markets protection as a capital tool as well as protection. ILS investors are by now familiar with these deals and the diverse range of risks included in them, so we expect to see broad support for AIG’s latest deal.In terms of pricing, we understand that the one-year tranche of Class 1-B notes are being marketed with price guidance of 6.5% to 7.5%, the Class 3-A tranche which sit higher up and feature the drop-down have price guidance of 4.75% to 5.5% and the Class 3-B notes sitting beneath 3-A have guidance of 6.5% to 7.5%.Update 1:Tradewynd Re Ltd. (Series 2014-1) has increased in size while marketing by 67% to now offer $500m of notes to investors.The Class 1-B tranche of notes remain at $100m, the Class 3-A tranche of notes with a three-year risk period also stay at $100m in size, but the other three-year tranche, the Class 3-B notes has been increased in size to $300m.In terms of pricing, the Class 1-B notes launched with price guidance of 6.5% to 7.5%, but are now offered at 6.75% to 7%. The Class 3-A tranche, which sit higher up and feature the drop-down, launched with guidance of 4.75% to 5.5%, which has narrowed to 5% to 5.12%. Finally, the Class 3-B notes which has upsized to $300m and sit beneath 3-A, launched with guidance of 6.5% to 7.5%, but are now offered with tightened guidance of 6.75% to 7%.Update 2:Artemis understands that at final pricing on Friday, all the tranches were priced and two priced below the middle of guidance while the third priced at the mid-point.The Class 1-B notes have now settled with pricing of 6.75%. The Class 3-A tranche has been set at pricing at 5%. Finally, the Class 3-B notes have been priced at 7%.The Class 1-B tranche of notes has an expected loss of 2.2%, so with pricing set at 6.75% the multiple for these notes is 3.1 times. The Class 3-A tranche of notes has an expected loss of 1.14%, which with pricing set at 5% sees them with a multiple of 4.4 times the expected loss. Finally, the Class 3-B tranche has an expected loss of 2.2%, so with a coupon of 7% is a multiple of 3.2 times.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The transaction covers a closed block of policies assumed by RGA Reinsurance Company, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of RGA, between 2006 and 2010. The net proceeds made from the sale of the notes will be used by RGA for general corporate purposes.Chesterfield Financial Holdings LLC, a Delaware domiciled company established by RGA, issued and sold to investors $300m of 4.5% Class A notes. The transaction has a term of 20 years (maturity due in December 2034) but the single tranche of Class A notes have an average life of 4.7 years.Being able to recognise value and monetise it from portfolios of insurance risk is one of the use-cases of securitization and embedded value life deals remain an underutilised technique to achieve this. There had been an expectation that European life insurers may embrace embedded value securitisation deals as a way to improve capital in the face of Solvency II, but that has yet to be seen.Principal repayment on these embedded value notes is linked to the future profits of the covered closed block of yearly renewable term reinsurance business, which consists of around 600 reinsurance treaties underwritten by RGA Re from over 100 separate life insurance groups.Investors will receive regular quarterly interest payments and return of principal as long as the expected return of profits and performance of the closed book is as modelled and expected. A rise in mortality experience is the main factor that could erode the performance of the closed book, however these notes are not directly linked to mortality experience or a mortality trigger, making them a similar but different structure to a mortality catastrophe bond.Standard & Poor’s noted in the transaction pre-sale report that pandemic is the major risk that could impact the notes. Major pandemics, such as a repeat of the 1918 Spanish flu, could cause a default for the notes such as a missed interest payment, but the risk is generally considered to be relatively low with this securitization.RGA, through an intermediary holding company, formed Chesterfield Financial Holdings LLC and its wholly owned life insurance company subsidiary Chesterfield Reinsurance Company for the purpose of this transaction.Towers Watson provided independent third-party analysis of the cash flows under various scenarios for the notes.Credit Agricole Securities, a subsidiary of Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, was the structuring lead and sole book runner on the transaction.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2013-1) from mid-2013, the 2011 transaction is scheduled to mature in January 2015.As a result it seems Amlin is returning to the cat bond market in the hopes of renewing this slice of protection it benefits with from the capital markets.In this deal Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurance vehicle Tramline Re II Ltd. is seeking to issue a single $150m tranche of Series 2014-1 Class A notes. The sale of the notes will be used to provide fully-collateralized reinsurance protection to Amlin AG over a four-year terms to the end of 2018.The single tranche of Tramline Re II 2014-1 cat bond notes will be exposed to U.S. named storms (so tropical storms and hurricances), U.S. earthquakes and European windstorms, all on a per-occurrence basis.All three perils feature an industry loss index trigger, with the U.S. named storm and earthquake coverage using a PCS state weighted index trigger and the European windstorm coverage using a PERILS country weighted index trigger.This transaction is a much higher risk layer of cat bond notes than the majority of the recent deals to come to market. We understand that the notes initial attachment probability is 6.68%, exhaustion probability is 3.97%, while the expected loss is 5.12%. The notes will attach at an index calculation level of 500 and exhaust at 700 on the index, we’re told.In terms of pricing guidance, we understand that the $150m of Tramline Re II 2014-1 notes are being marketed to investors with a coupon range of 10% to 10.75%.Comparing the multiple of Amlin AG’s maturing cat bond deal from 2011 with this new one shows that the pricing is very keen. The Tramline Re Ltd. 2011-1 cat bond had an expected loss of 3.49%, so by the modeling was lower risk, but paid a coupon of 16.75%, so a much higher coupon. That resulted in a multiple of about 4.8 times the expected loss.This new Tramline Re II 2014-1 cat bond has an expected loss of 5.12% and potential coupon in the range of 10% to 10.75%, the resulting multiple of this new cat bond could be from 2.1X to 2X the expected loss, which is low even by recent cat bond levels.Update 1:This cat bond upsized by 33% while pricing down during marketing to a size of $200m, reflecting strong investor demand.The price guidance was lowered down to a range of 9.75% to 10%, so narrowed and below the bottom of the original launch coupon range.

The reinsurance agreements will provide USAA with fully-collateralized reinsurance protection for certain U.S. tropical storm, earthquake, severe thunderstorm, winter storm, wildfire, volcanic eruption and meteorite impact risks.Again, the two unusual perils featuring in this deal are the same as in the earlier 2014 issuance, more volcanic eruption and meteorite impact risks. These two perils are again a low contributor to the cat bonds expected loss we understand, but USAA clearly feels that having named protection for these remote risks is worthwhile and that ILS investors will support its needs with attractively priced protection for them.The cat bond will provide USAA with reinsurance protection for a per-occurrence layer of its reinsurance program, from an attachment point of $2.175 billion to an exhaustion point of $3.188 billion, we understand.

The transaction is targeting an issuance of at least $350m which will be split between the two tranches as $150m of Class A notes and $200m of Class B.The proceeds of the sale of the two tranches of notes will be used to collateralize reinsurance contracts for the CEA, to provide it with a source of fully-collateralized, capital markets backed California earthquake reinsurance protection.Both of the tranches of notes issued by Ursa Re Ltd. will be structured featuring an indemnity trigger and the protection they afford the CEA will be on an annual aggregate basis. The term of the cat bond will be three years, with maturity due in December 2017.The $150m Class A tranche of notes feature an initial attachment probability of 1.29% and an initial expected loss of 1.2%. The $200m of Class B notes are a higher risk layer of protection, featuring an initial attachment probability of 2.9% and an initial expected loss of 2.62%. We’re told that each of the two tranches issued will cover a percentage of a corresponding layer of the CEA’s reinsurance program.In terms of price guidance, we’re told that the Class A notes are being offered with a proposed coupon range of 3% to 3.75%, while the Class B notes have coupon guidance of 4.5% to 5.25%The CEA is only an insurer of residential earthquake risks so as a result the covered business does not include any commercial properties in California.The notes provide a variable reset feature which will allow the CEA to flex the coverage provided and move it, within pre-defined limits, up or down its reinsurance tower to a degree. The coupon will be adjusted accordingly as you’d expect.We understand that the transaction is targeting completion for the beginning of December.Update 1:The Class A tranche, which is the less risky of the two, has now increased in size to $200m, taking the total deal size to $400m.At the same time price guidance has been narrowed, with both tranches seeing guidance moving towards the middle of the launch range.The Class A notes were initially offered with a proposed coupon range of 3% to 3.75%, which has now been narrowed to 3.25% to 3.5% we understand. Meanwhile the Class B notes, which launched with coupon guidance of 4.5% to 5.25%, have seen that narrow to 4.75% to 5%.Update 2:The Class A notes have now been priced at the top of that revised range, so above the initial mid-point of guidance, at 3.5%. Interestingly that gives this tranche a multiple of the expected loss of 1.2% to coupon of 2.9X, which is aligned with the average seen this year.The Class B notes also priced at the top end of revised guidance, at 5%, again above the initial mid-point. These notes, with an expected loss of 2.62% have a much lower multiple, coming in at 1.91X, suggesting investors perhaps had greater appetite for the higher coupon.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The reinsurer is seeking $350m of protection from the bond, which together with its earlier cat bond would give Everest Re $800m of protection from the capital markets in cat bond form.Kilimanjaro Re Ltd., Everest Re’s Bermuda domiciles special purpose insurer, will seek to issue a single tranche of Series 2014-2 Class C notes which will be exposed to U.S. and Canadian earthquakes. The deal is said to have a five-year term and the structure has been designed around a PCS industry loss trigger.Coverage will be for the U.S., Puerto Rico and also Canada, sources tell us. The trigger itself will be a regional weighted industry loss index, based on PCS reported catastrophe losses for qualifying earthquake events. The cat bond will provide per-occurrence protection from an initial industry loss index attachment point of $1.075 billion up to $2.150 billion.S&P always stresses the exceedence probability curve of a cat bond deal when rating it, to take into account any uncertainty or unmodelled risks. In the case of this cat bond S&P notes that it applied a slightly higher stress level, than it would typically for an industry loss cat bond deal, primarily due to the cat bond having exposure to the Cascadian subduction zone, the potential for losses related to a tsunami and because there isn’t a maximum time frame specified over which an earthquake event could occur. However this additional stress test did not change the rating.The concerns that S&P cites are;* The risks of a Cascadian subduction zone eruption could be slightly understated.
* Tsunamis are not a modeled risk for the entire covered area.
* There is significant exposure to losses in Canada, resulting in currency risk. On this point S&P notes that if there were a 10% negative movement in the exchange rate, U.S. to Canadian dollar, the probability of attachment would increase by three basis points.
* Investment risk related to the Treasury money market funds held in the reinsurance trust account. Interestingly the collateral will be invested in a named fund, the Morgan Stanley Institutional Liquidity Fund. We don’t typically see a fund named, it is more usual to just see that it will be invested in money market funds.Historical risk modelling by AIR Worldwide shows that there have been six earthquake events since 1700 that would have resulted in a reduction in principal to the cat bond notes:The 1732 Montreal Region; 1906 San Francisco; 1811-1812 New Madrid; 1700 Cascadia; 1886 Charleston, S.C.; and 1838 San Andreas fault (extending from San Francisco to San Juan Bautista) earthquakes. The first four events would have resulted in a 100% reduction of principal and the last two would in a 70% and 32% principal reduction, respectively. The 1994 Northridge and 1989 Loma Prieta events generated model event index values of $706 million and $190.5 million, respectively.As you’d expect, California contributes the highest percentage of the expected loss for this cat bond, at 50.4%, with commercial exposures making up the largest proportion. Interestingly though, the next highest regional risk is in Quebec, British Columbia and Washington.The initial attachment probability for the notes will be set at 2.26%, while the initial expected loss will be 1.46%.In terms of pricing, we understand that the Kilimanjaro Re 2014-2 catastrophe bond notes will be marketed with a coupon guidance range of 3.5% to 4%.>Update 1:The Kilimanjaro Re Ltd. (Series 2014-2) catastrophe bond reflecting strong investor demand for the ILS asset class is set to increase in size by 43% to secure the reinsurer $500m of protection.The single tranche of Series 2014-2 Class C notes, exposed to U.S., Puerto Rico and also Canada earthquakes on a PCS industry loss trigger and per-occurrence basis, launched with price guidance of 3.5% to 4%. We understand that this guidance has moved to the mid-point at 3.75% where investors tell us they have an expectation it will stay when the deal reaches final pricing later today.With an initial expected loss of 1.46% and pricing at 3.75% the deals multiple will be 2.6X.>Update 2:The final pricing for this cat bond came in at 3.75%, while the size remained at $500m.S&P assigned its ‘BB-(sf)’ preliminary rating to the notes, which cover losses on a per-occurrence basis from earthquakes (including fire following) in all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all provinces and territories of Canada.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Golden State Re II Ltd. (Series 2014-1)","Golden State Re II Ltd. (Series 2014-1)","California State Compensation Insurance Fund","Willis Capital Markets & Advisory are sole structuring agent and bookrunner","RMS","Workers compensation claims resulting from California earthquakes","$250m","Modelled loss","S&P: 'BB+'","Sep 2014","This transaction is very similar to the SCIF’s 2011 Golden State Re Ltd. deal.A new special purpose vehicle has been established for this renewal issue, with Golden State Re II Ltd. being incorporated in Bermuda as a special purpose insurer.This Golden State Re II cat bond issuance will see a single tranche of Series 2014-1 notes marketed to investors for the sponsor SCIF.The deal is expected to be sized at $150m or over, depending on ILS investor appetite.The SCIF will enter into a reinsurance agreement with Golden State Re II, in order to benefit from the source of fully-collateralized reinsurance protection.The protection will be afforded on a per-occurrence basis using a modelled loss trigger in the same fashion as the 2011 cat bond issue. The transaction will cover the SCIF until January 2019, so more than four years which is a year longer than its 2011 issues tenure.The covered area is for earthquake events in the entire U.S., but as with the 2011 deal as much as 99.99% of the SCIF’s insurance portfolio is focused on California, as its name gives away. As a result the risk is focused on California area earthquakes.The modelled loss trigger uses a variety of inputs and a calculation process to derive whether an event has triggered the cat bond. The trigger is of similar construct to the 2011 deal, using the exposures of a notional portfolio of workers compensation risks in the SCIF’s portfolio, earthquake severity factors (ground motion), geographic distribution of the covered portfolio, types of buildings covered, time of day and the day of week an event occurs as some of the weighting factors.After an event, which we believe has to be an earthquake of magnitude 5.5 or greater, losses will be modelled deterministically, so not related to actual injuries and fatalities, using the earthquake event parameters and this will be modelled against the notional portfolio using day/time weighting to determine an index value and notional modelled loss amount.A calculation process will be run post-event to derive an index value which will be compared against an attachment point. The attachment point is at 1,000, and the exhaustion at 1,903. The 2011 deal also attached at 1,000 but exhausted at 1,447, so this deal may cover a larger layer of the SCIF’s reinsurance programme.The initial attachment probability for the notes will be 0.5%, while the initial exhaustion probability will be 0.11% and initial expected loss 0.25%. The expected loss of the 2011 deal was 0.36% for comparison, which suggests the 2014 Golden State Re II cat bond is a little lower risk.As a result the coupon guidance is low for this cat bond, although low is to be expected in the current market environment anyway. The deal is marketing with coupon guidance of 2.2% to 2.7%. Again for comparison, the coupon of the 2011 Golden State Re cat bond was 3.77%.Standard & Poor’s gave the notes a preliminary rating of ‘BB+(sf)’, noting that:The modeling results assume events are evenly distributed throughout a day. Since the timing of an event will have an impact on the loss amount, we reviewed two sensitivity tests that adjusted (in hourly increments) the time of each stochastic event by plus/minus two hours and six hours from its original time. Using the initial index values and the adjusted index values, the highest notional modeled loss from each event was used to construct a new exceedance probability curve and the results were consistent with a nat-cat factor of ‘bb+’.The rating is based on the lowest of the natural catastrophe risk factor, ‘BB+’, the rating on the assets in the reinsurance trust account, ‘AAAm’, and the creditworthiness of the ceding insurer.The ‘bb+’ natural catastrophe risk factor was derived by S&P using the risk model that the transaction was structured with. RMS is the risk modelling firm in question and its RMS U.S. Earthquake Casualty Model, updated in 2014, as implemented in RiskLink version 13.1 is the model in use for the deal.S&P notes that the risk modelling for the cat bond is based on the notional portfolio of SCIF risk as at 30th April 2014, so if the cat bond is triggered the actual exposure will be different due to the passage of time, but not sufficiently to cause any concern. The notional portfolio is expected to adequately reflect the covered business throughout the life of the deal. An updated notional portfolio may be provided with the reset, which should help to keep any gap between notional and actual exposure to a minimum.S&P always tests the modelling results and sometimes applies incremental stress factors, such as adjusting the modelled probability of attachment, if its criteria require it. S&P’s catastrophe bond rating criteria prescribes that it applies a 7.5% stress level to a modelled loss transaction, although this can differ depending on the company’s strengths, concerns and mitigating factors.S&P noted its concerns about the transaction. Firstly, the time of day factor having such a potential impact on the resulting event index level (hence the additional testing mentioned above. Secondly, the fact that there may be triggering events which are not captured by the model, always an issue with an earthquake bond particularly in an area with so many faults as California. And third, the investment risk that the Treasury money market funds used as collateral may have, although as we all know these are about as low-risk as collateral assets can get.Based on RMS’s risk analysis there have been three historical events which could have generated an index value high enough to breach the attachment level of the notes had they occurred at specific times of day. These are the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake had it occurred at 2 p.m. and the 1906 San Francisco and 1994 Northridge earthquakes, had they occurred between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.However, each of these historical earthquake events actually occurred at times where the modelled index values that RMS generated were not in excess of the attachment point. This shows just how the modelled loss trigger has been constructed to closely match the modelled loss with a workers compensation claim level, thus providing the cover the SCIF seeks.The main exposure for this earthquake is in California, despite it covering all 50 U.S. states. In fact 99.99% of the SCIF portfolio is located in California, hence the coverage is targeted there. For an event to qualify it must be at least magnitude 5.5, which does mean that recent events such as the Napa earthquake would have qualified and may have resulted in the index values having to be generated by the calculation agent, although with no chance of reaching the trigger we’d imagine.In terms of which part of California is most risky for this cat bond, Los Angeles County contributes 52.1% of the expected loss, Orange County 10%, Alameda County 6.1%, San Bernardino 5.8% while the rest contribute under 4%. Even San Francisco only contributes 3.6% to expected loss. This shows that the focus of the notional workers compensation portfolio’s exposure is on Los Angeles.Employees working in offices make up 47% of the employees covered, which again ties in with a focus on LA. 9am to 4pm on a weekday is the riskiest time for this cat bond with the modelled contribution by time of day highest between these hours, according to S&P.The way the cat bond trigger has been constructed ensures it provides the coverage the SCIF requires, for workers compensation claims it suffers due to earthquakes. The index value could therefore be very different for an earthquake occurring outside working hours, or at the weekend, compared to one which occurred in the middle of a working day.The contribution to modelled losses by time of day even dips slightly around lunchtime, as more workers will be outside of the workplace should an earthquake occur at that time. This is intelligent use of modelling and data to construct a catastrophe bond that meets the needs of the ceding party.*Update 1:* The Golden State Re II catastrophe bond upsized by two-thirds to reach $250m in capacity, offering the SCIF $50m more than its maturing cat bond.At the same time the price guidance narrowed and fell approximately 5% to a range of 2.2% to 2.45%.*Update 2:* At final pricing the coupons settled at the bottom end of the initial range, at 2.2%, which represents a -10% drop from the mid-point of guidance, or as much as -18.5% from the top of that initially marketed range.

The numbering convention is out of sync as deal IV completed more quickly than this Dodeka III transaction.Dodeka III is a zero coupon, including the premium, privately placed catastrophe bond. The Dodeka III deal is just $10m in size and the underlying risk is not from a reinsurance contract, rather it is from an industry loss warranty (ILW) derivative contract which is transformed into a cat bond for Twelve Capital.Dodeka III provides coverage for U.S. all natural perils, so including risk such as U.S. wind risks, U.S. earthquake, U.S. severe thunderstorms, U.S. winter storms and wildfire.As the private cat bond has been transformed from an ILW the deal features an industry loss index, with Property Claim Services (PCS) acting as the reporting agency and providing data on industry losses.The Dodeka III deal has a one year term, having been completed on the 1st August and with coverage running until maturity on the 31st July 2015.Dodeka III is a third-event cover, meaning that for the deal to be triggered during the term of the cat bond three (or more) qualifying catastrophe events which cause a market loss above a pre-defined level must occur.This is actually the only third-event catastrophe bond in the outstanding market at this time.The Dodeka III cat bond will pay an equivalent of a high-single digit return to investors, somewhere between 5% and 10%, which is higher than many recent catastrophe bond issues.The Dodeka III private catastrophe bond, like the previous three Dodeka deals, was issued through the Kane SAC Limited private cat bond platform, which is operated by global independent insurance manager Kane.The $10m of Dodeka III private cat bond notes will be listed on the Bermuda Stock exchange, enhancing their liquidity and providing Twelve Capital with improved options and additional transparency to trade the notes on the secondary market.

The transaction is targeting September for launch, when the Hoplon Insurance deal matures, and will run for just over the three years, until the end of 2017. The duration of the transaction is split into three aggregate risk periods.The Hoplon II Insurance bond will protect MyLotto24 initially across three of its key lottery games, the German Lottery, the Eurojackpot and the Euromillones, we understand. Both jackpot winnings and also tax shortfalls on jackpot winnings are covered under the terms of the deal, both on an ultimate net loss basis.Hoplon II Insurance features two tranches of notes linked to lottery jackpot risks. Both the Class A and Class B tranche of notes are sized at €25m each.The Class A notes have an attachment point of €85m and an exhaustion point of €110m, we are told. The initial attachment probability is 3.95% and the initial expected loss is 2.32%. The Class B notes attach at €60m and exhaust at €85m of qualifying jackpot losses. The Class B attachment probability is 7.28% and the expected loss is 5.38%.We’re told that the deal will likely complete in August and that the notes will pay investors a small coupon of 1.5% up until the beginning of the first risk period in September. This is a good strategy as it will allow MyLotto24 to lock in the cover, while keeping investors happy with a small return for no risk at all (until the risk period begins).Once the risk periods begin, we understand that the Class A notes are being offered with price guidance of 6.5% to 7.5%, while the Class B notes are being offered with price guidance of 11.25% to 12.25%, so these notes will pay a reasonable coupon, although the Class B notes multiple is quite low.We’re told that the collateralized reinsurance layer, which Hoplon II Insurance will enter into privately, will cover losses below the two tranches of notes, from €35m to €60m of losses. So the rate on-line for the reinsurance layer will no doubt be higher than the return on the insurance-linked notes issued by Hoplon II.Once again Milliman Inc. features in the latest Hoplon deal as the reset agent. The Hoplon II Insurance structure allows for a number of different types of resets, we’re told, including the ability to opt for a variable reset to move the coverage limits and a reset to allow lottery games to be changed or added, amongst others.Update 1:The Class A notes launched with price guidance of 6.5% to 7.5% and we understand that the pricing has settled at the bottom end of that range, at 6.5%.The Class B notes launched with guide pricing of 11.25% to 12.25%.

Cover from the cat bond notes is on a per-occurrence basis.“We continue to see the momentum of deals increasing. Both cedants and investors are recognizing the opportunity and value of transacting via cat bonds,” said Michael Popkin, Managing Director and Co-Head of Insurance-Linked Securities at Jardine Lloyd Thompson Capital Markets. “With each transaction, we are expanding the number of investors who are familiar with the Market Re platform.”“Market Re allows us to customize risk transfer for our clients and then convert these into cat bonds in a scalable way that makes it efficient for cedants and investors alike,” added Rick Miller, Managing Director and Co-Head of Insurance-Linked Securities at Jardine Lloyd Thompson Capital Markets. “The Market Re transactions are definitely enabling us to open up the cat bond market to more cedants.”The cedant in this case requested the tranches approach to the cat bond, so resulting in the issuance of both Class A and Class B notes. Both tranches are identical in every way except for size, but this is how the cedant requested it which we would assume is to better fit within their overall reinsurance programme tower. Both tranches of notes will pay investors a coupon of 4%, according to JLTCM.Another factor with Market Re which the sponsors of cat bonds are appreciating is the anonymity, according to JLTCM. “Market Re allows for a cedant to remain anonymous, which is the case here. This is one of the other advantages of Market Re, which cedants are finding valuable,” said Michael Popkin.Also of note is the fact that the cedant funded the interest upfront, so ensuring the payment will always be there for investors and removing any question of credit risk.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

GC Securities are sole placement agent.","?","Caribbean hurricane and earthquake","$30m","Parametric modelled loss","NR","Jun 2014","The World Bank has issued (perhaps directly sponsored) its first catastrophe bond, according to reports, in a $30m deal designed to provide hurricane and earthquake reinsurance protection to the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF).The issuance will provide the CCRIF with a fully-collateralized source of reinsurance protection against hurricanes and earthquakes impacting its 16 member island nations. The deal provides three years of protection to the CCRIF.The 16 current members of the CCRIF are: Anguilla, Antigua & Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent & the Grenadines, Trinidad & Tobago, Turks & Caicos Islands.This is not a typical catastrophe bond issuance. No special purpose insurer has been used as an issuing vehicle, as would be more typical of a cat bond deal. The World Bank’s Treasury unit has its own bond issuance platform, the Global Debt Issuance Facility and these catastrophe linked notes have been issued directly by the World Bank as a series of unsecured general obligation bonds.In the past a $30m top layer of the CCRIF’s catastrophe reinsurance program had been transferred to the capital markets in a catastrophe swap form, it would appear that this cat bond is to replace that layer.The way the CCRIF provides its protection to its members means that this cat bond will contain some risk of storm surge, as well as wind from tropical cyclones, as well as the earthquake risk. The CCRIF takes parameters of an event and applies them to member government exposure information to determine a loss estimate.The issuance uses a parametric modelled loss arrangement, the same as the underlying trigger for the CCRIF’s reinsurance program. The $30m of cover is assumed to be the same layer of the reinsurance program which was previously transferred to the capital markets in a catastrophe swap form. The catastrophe bond, or notes, can be triggered on an annual aggregate basis, so provide protection for losses from multiple events as well as a single large event. We do not have attachment probabilities at this time.The transaction sees the World Bank enter into a catastrophe swap with the CCRIF mirroring the terms of the cat bond. If the bond is triggered by a referenced natural hazard, hence the parametric trigger, then the principal of the bond will be reduced by an amount determined under the bond terms and an equivalent amount will be paid to CCRIF under the swap.The World Bank is standing between the investors in the cat bond, which the FT reports to be specialist insurance-linked securities funds, catastrophe funds, hedge funds and other investment companies.We understand that the notes have been issued in such a way as to be transferable in the secondary market, meaning they can have liquidity and the investors holding them will be able to sell them through secondary broking desks.The catastrophe bond is the first issuance through the World Bank’s newly created Capital-at-Risk Notes Program and was issued by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).The notes will pay investors a coupon of LIBOR plus 6.3% to 6.5%.Note: As this transaction does not use an SPI, as would be more typical of most cat bonds, the name we have given it of ‘World Bank – CCRIF 2014-1’ is our own naming, not an official series name.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

A $4.525m Class A tranche of notes provides the cedant with multi-section reinsurance coverage of a top/drop nature. A $27.3m Class B tranche of notes provides second-event protection to the cedant.The transaction is again achieved in a zero coupon format, like so many other JLTCM arranged private cat bonds, with investors performing their own risk analysis in order to become comfortable with the risks involved.Insurance-linked securities investors will see the Market Re development as a positive for the market, with the potential to bring a significant additional chunk of investment capacity to those investors seeking catastrophe bond opportunities.With JLTCM targeting smaller sponsors, or those new to cat bonds, any risk capital committed is likely additional to the typical cat bond market pipeline of 144A broadly marketed deals. Therefore these private issuance facilities have the potential to help the overall ILS market grow, particularly important in the current market environment.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Queen Street X Re Ltd.","Queen Street X Re Ltd.","Munich Re","Munich Re is structuring the deal. Deutsche Bank Securities is bookrunner.","AIR Worldwide","U.S. hurricane, Australia cyclone","Not issued","Industry loss index and modelled industry loss index","?","Jun 2014","Note: The Queen Street X Re Ltd. cat bond issuance was not completed. It was withdrawn as the capacity and price targets could not be met, we understand.Queen Street X Re Limited is an Irish domiciled special purpose vehicle, the second in the series to be located in Europe closer to the reinsurers home territory. Munich Re is again seeking further capital markets participation in its retro program at a similar attachment probability to its previous two Queen Street cat bonds. We’re told that the deal is being marketed without a target size at this time.With this Queen Street X Re cat bond Munich Re is seeking a source of fully-collateralized retrocessional reinsurance protection from U.S. hurricanes and Australian cyclones. The protection provided by Queen Street X Re will be on a per-occurrence basis, as were the previous two Queen Street’s, and the same triggers will be used, a county and line of business weighted PCS industry loss index for U.S. hurricanes and a postcode as well as line of business weighted modelled industry loss index for Australian cyclone risks.The retrocessional coverage from Queen Street X Re will benefit Munich Re for three hurricane seasons, up to the end of 2016 and to May 2017 for Australian cyclone risks, so covering three cyclone seasons which run from November to April.The probabilities of attachment, exhaustion and expected loss for Queen Street X Re are very similar to the previous two cat bonds from Munich Re, which makes it a useful deal for pricing comparison purposes. The initial attachment probability is said to be 3.92%, the exhaustion probability is 1.91% and the expected loss 2.72%. The expected loss is identical to Queen Street IX and Queen Street VIII.As we understand it, there are no significant historical hurricane or cyclone events which would have caused a sufficient industry loss to trigger this cat bond, showing that it is a remote risk. We’re told that U.S. hurricane risk contributes just over half of this cat bonds expected loss, where as the Queen Street IX was slightly more exposed to Australian cyclones.The price guidance on the Queen Street X Re Ltd. cat bond is reflective of the decline in catastrophe reinsurance pricing globally, with this deal launching with guidance of 4.75% to 5.5%. That compares to final pricing of 6.5% for Queen Street VIII Re a year ago and 5.5% for Queen Street IX Re in February.The multiple tells the story of catastrophe bond market pricing declining over the last twelve months. A year ago, Queen Street VIII had a multiple of 2.4 times expected loss. In February the multiple dropped to 2.02 times expected losses. Now, the latest deal if it priced at a mid-point could see the multiple of expected loss to coupon drop below 2 times which is low for any cat bond.Update 1:According to sources the Queen Street X Re Ltd. catastrophe bond is expected to price at the top end of guidance, at 5.5%.Update 2:The Queen Street X Re Ltd. cat bond issuance was not completed.

As with the previous Oak Leaf cat bond deals, the Series 2014-1 transaction is being issued through Oak Leaf Re Ltd., a Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurer.The JLTCM team arranged the first $11.95m private placement of cat bond notes through the Oak Leaf Re 2011-1 transaction, then helped the sponsor double the cover it secured from the cat bond market with Oak Leaf Re 2012-1 coming in at $22.78m, before growing the deal again to $30.49m in 2013 with Oak Leaf Re Ltd..The $44.035m Oak Leaf Re 2014-1 private cat bond provides the cedant with a one-year source of fully-collateralized catastrophe reinsurance protection for losses to its Florida book of business, incurred from Florida named storms, using an indemnity trigger. The cat bond is split into three tranches of notes, each attaching at different levels of loss to the cedant.The Oak Leaf transaction structures are unique in that the three tranches fulfill very different protection requirements for the cedant. The Class A tranche, which is $36.8m in size, provides both severity and aggregate protection in a top and drop mutli-section structure. The Class C tranche of notes, $2.125m in size, provides multi-section cover at a much lower level in the cedants reinsurance tower. The final tranche of Class D notes, $5.11m in size, provides reinstatement premium protection for the cedant.JLTCM told Artemis that it was the larger Class A tranche of notes which upsized, growing approximately 30% during the offering period for this cat bond. Across the three tranches of notes the final pricing was approximately 6% to 10% below the original guidance, demonstrating investors appetite for the notes.Rick Miller told Artemis that the pricing achieved for the Oak Leaf Re 2014-1 private cat bond was; “Materially lower than seen last year for the expiring program.”As with all of the JLTCM private cat bonds there was no third-party risk modelling agency contracted for the deal and the investors performed their own analysis of the risks and modelling for the bond, developing their own unique views of the risk, hence there is no single attachment probability or expected loss that can be disclosed.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Alamo Re Ltd. (Series 2014-1)","Alamo Re Ltd. (Series 2014-1)","Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA)","GC Securities is sole structuring agent and bookrunner","AIR Worldwide","Texas named storms","$400m","Indemnity","Fitch  'B+sf'","Jun 2014","The Texas Windstorm Insurance Association’s cat bond has been launched to the market and is to be issued by Bermuda registered special purpose insurer Alamo Re Ltd. TWIA is using German reinsurer Hannover Re as the ceding reinsurer in the transaction, so TWIA enters into a reinsurance agreement with Hannover Re while it enters into a retrocession agreement with Alamo Re Ltd.In this cat bond issuance Alamo Re Ltd. is set to issue and sell to investors a single tranche of Series 2014-1 notes to collateralize the retrocessional agreement with Hannover Re and ultimately the reinsurance agreement with TWIA. The single tranche of notes are sized at $300m at launch, although that could grow if TWIA sticks to its $400m target, and have a three-year term, with maturity expected at 1st June 2017.The Alamo Re 2014-1 catastrophe bond will provide three years of reinsurance protection, ultimately to TWIA, on an annual aggregate basis using an indemnity trigger based on TWIA’s ultimate net losses suffered in the covered area. The protection is for Texas named storms, meaning that the Alamo Re cat bond will cover TWIA for losses from hurricanes and tropical storms.Only named storms that affect Texas and cause an ultimate net loss to TWIA of more than $50m will qualify as covered under the terms of the Alamo Re cat bond, we’re told. That means that TWIA, while gaining the aggregate benefit of protection for frequent smaller windstorms affecting Texas, will not see its aggregate eroded by the smallest of storms. Using the named storm definition for tropical cyclones also means that perils such as hail and tornadoes which occur due to tropical storm systems will also qualify if they cause a sufficiently large loss to TWIA.The Alamo Re 2014-1 cat bond will trigger at the private reinsurance layer attachment point of $1.9 billion and will provide cover up to the layer exhaustion point of $3.25 billion. This means the cat bond will provide reinsurance for a percentage of TWIA’s losses within the private reinsurance layer. It also means that should TWIA choose to it could upsize the cat bond even further than the $400m if it should deem it more cost-effective than traditional reinsurance protection.The $300m of notes being issued by Alamo Re Ltd. in this Series 2014-1 deal have an attachment probability of 3.8%, an expected loss of 2.84% and an exhaustion probability of 2.09%, Artemis understands. The notes are being marketed with coupon price guidance of 6.5% to 7%.Update 1:Further details have emerged thanks to the rating report from Fitch Ratings.Fitch’s article on the deal discusses the covered portfolio of business, which the rating agency says is located across the 14 first-tier coastal counties of Texas (as well as a small portion of Harris County). The subject business represents $84.4 billion (as of Dec. 31, 2013) of total insured value. The subject business consists of 85% residential and 15% commercial properties, with a minimal amount of exposure to mobile homes.The exposures covered by the Alamo Re cat bond are concentrated in Galveston and Brazoria counties, which between them represent 50% of the total insured value. Galveston is 30% of the insured values at risk, Brazoria 20%, Nueces 18%, Jefferson 12% and Cameron 6%, Artemis understands.Interestingly, the percentage of insurable value is not the same as the percentage contribution to expected losses by county. Galveston alone contributes 50% of the Alamo Re cat bonds expected loss, Artemis understands, while Nueces is 16%, Brazoria 11% and Jefferson 7% of the deals expected loss.Fitch Ratings notes that there have been 37 hurricanes that have made landfall in Texas since 1900. In 2008, the combined impacts of hurricane Ike and hurricane Dolly would have eroded the Alamo Re cat bond principal by 26%. Hurricane Rita from 2005 would not have caused any losses. Four historical no name hurricanes prior to 1933 would have caused a 100% loss of principal on a modelled basis.The Alamo Re cat bond features an optional variable reset facility which will allow TWIA to adjust the attachment level of the notes within a pre-defined range of attachment probability. The deals initial attachment probability is 3.8% and at reset TWIA can opt to reset that to anywhere in the range of 4.4% to 1.75%, so the notes could become riskier or indeed less risky. Investors will be compensated for any increase or decrease in risk level assumed as the risk interest spread will be recalculated to reflect any change in exceedance probability.Fitch noted a number of aspects about the Alamo Re cat bond which are unmodelled, or not included in the modelling performed by AIR Worldwide.Firstly, the modelling did not include costs associated to debris removal, however this was implicit in the claims data history. The model only simulates hurricane activity making landfall, which means it understates losses related to named storms or hurricanes that degrade prior to landfall. That is quite important as losses from storms which do not reach hurricane status could be sufficient to qualify and begin to erode the aggregate attachment layer during an annual period.Also it’s not clear whether the model would have analysed the risks of tornadoes or hail resulting from named storms, which we understood to be covered by this cat bond as TWIA has expressed a desire to have a cat bond which provided protection against these smaller, or related perils that the tropical storm season can bring to Texas.Fitch notes that investors will be exposed to any basis risk between the modelled results and the actual ultimate net losses suffered by TWIA. There has always been an element of basis risk between modelled results and actual losses in cat bonds but this does seem to be widening with the more recent trends to expand the protection provided.Fitch also notes that there is a risk that transforming reinsurer Hannover Re could not pay its retrocessional premiums which are a component of the coupon payment. This is an extremely remote risk given Hannover Re’s size, standing in the reinsurance market and stability.Update 2:The Alamo Re cat bond has upsized to TWIA’s targeted $400m.At the same time as upsizing the price guidance on the Alamo Re cat bond notes has been lowered and narrowed to a range of 6.35% to 6.5%.Update 3:At final pricing the Alamo Re cat bond has priced at the low-end of the reduced range, to offer its investors a coupon of 6.35%.Update 4, June 2nd 2015:TWIA elected to use the variable reset to adjust the attachment probability of Alamo Re 2014-1, in order to arrange its reinsurance programme to take into account new purchases and the two Alamo Re 2015-1 cat bond tranches.Fitch initially rated the Alamo Re Ltd. series 2014-1 class A notes at ‘Bsf’ when the deal was issued, but after the annual reset, which saw the modeled attachment probability lowered to 2.09% from its initial annual attachment probability of 3.80%, the 2014-1 notes have now been upgraded to ‘B+sf’.Any cat bond with an attachment probability below 3.015% on Fitch’s Insurance Linked Securities Calibration Table is rated as ‘B+sf’ or higher.At the reset, risk modeller AIR also recalculated the risk interest spread for the 2014-1 class A notes to 5.24%, a decrease from the initial spread of 6.35%.Using the variable reset allows TWIA to move the attachment level of the Alamo Re 2014-1 class A notes up to $3.2 billion, from the initial attachment level of $1.9 billion. At the same time TWIA elected to increase the notes insurance percentage to 50% of its respective layer, up from approximately 30%.Now, after the reset, TWIA has the Alamo Re 2014-1 Class A notes positioned in between the Series 2015-1 Class A and Class B notes, with all three tranches having a 50% co-participation alongside traditional reinsurance.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Deutsche Bank is co-manager.","AIR Worldwide","U.S. tropical cyclones, earthquakes, severe thunderstorms, winter storms, wildfire, meteorite impact, volcanic eruption","$130m","Indemnity","?","May 2014","This is the 22nd catastrophe bond transaction sponsored by USAA that we have recorded since 1997 in the Artemis Deal Directory.Residential Reinsurance 2014 Ltd., a Cayman Islands domiciled issuance vehicle, will seek to issue two tranches of Series 2014-1 cat bond notes on behalf of USAA and subsidiaries. The proceeds from the sale of the notes will be used to collateralize reinsurance agreements between USAA and Residential Re 2014. Artemis understands that USAA is looking for at least $100m of protection from this issuance, although sources said that it is capped for now at $150m across the two tranches as a maximum.The Residential Re 2014 catastrophe bond will provide USAA and certain subsidiaries with reinsurance protection across a range of U.S. perils, including tropical cyclones, earthquakes, severe thunderstorms, winter storms, wildfire, meteorite impact and volcanic eruption.Of that list of perils two are very unusual. This is the first catastrophe bond to provide cover for losses from meteorite impacts, a very remote risk likely only contributing a small amount to the cat bonds expected losses. It is also the first cat bond we have seen which explicitly includes cover for losses from volcanic eruptions. We have seen volcanic eruptions caused by earthquakes included in a cat bond before, but never as a standalone peril like this.The reinsurance protection provided by this cat bond features an indemnity trigger and the cover is on an annual aggregate basis for both tranche of notes. The covered area is all 50 U.S. states for the perils of earthquakes, severe thunderstorms, winter storms, wildfire, meteorite impact and volcanic eruption, while tropical cyclone cover is for the usual Gulf Coast, Florida, East Coast, Hawaii states as well as a few further inland, which makes sense for wind cover on an aggregate basis. The term of the deal will be four years, we understand.The first tranche of notes being issued by Residential Reinsurance 2014 Ltd. in this Series 2014-1 cat bond deal is a Class 10 tranche sized at $50m. These notes have an attachment probability of 11.84%, an exhaustion probability of 8.08% and an expected loss of 9.86%. These are risky cat bond notes, although not quite as risky as the tranche USAA issued last year. The attachment point is at $847m of losses and the exhaustion is at $947m, so covering a $100m layer of USAA’s program.The second tranche is a Class 13 tranche of notes. These have an attachment probability of 0.85%, an exhaustion probability of 0.39% and an expected loss of 0.54%, so a much more remote risk. The attachment point is at $1.651 billion of losses and the exhaustion point is at $2.124 billion, so covering a large layer of USAA’s reinsurance program.In terms of pricing guidance, the Class 10 tranche of notes, the riskier of the two, has price guidance of 14% to 16%. The Class 13 tranche is offered with guidance of 2.75% to 3.5%.Interestingly, the Class 13 tranche is very similar in terms of attachment to a Class 5 tranche from USAA’s Residential Reinsurance 2012 Ltd. (Series 2012-1) cat bond. That tranche issued in 2012 priced at 8%, meaning that USAA’s 2014 cover from the Class 13 notes could price as much as 65% cheaper than it, if it priced at the bottom end of guidance at 2.75%.Update 1:Artemis understands that the Residential Re 2014-1 catastrophe bond is likely to upsize and it is now expected that the cat bond will provide between $125m and $150m of cover.The latest information is that the Class 10 tranche of notes is expected to grow to between $75m and $100m in size while the Class 13 tranche of notes remains at $50m.In terms of pricing, the riskier Class 10 notes are now being marketed with a 15% coupon, so the middle of launch guidance. The Class 13, lower risk, tranche of notes meanwhile has seen pricing moved to the top of the launch range at 3.5% we understand.Update 2:At pricing the Residential Re 2014-1 cat bond reached $130m in size. The Class 10 tranche of notes, the higher risk of the two, finally grew to $80m in size while the Class 13 tranche of notes remained at $50m.The Class 10 tranche has priced at the mid-point of the guidance range, at 15%, making them the highest returning tranche of cat bond notes issued this year and perhaps since USAA’s Residential Reinsurance 2013 Ltd. (Series 2013-2) cat bond deal.The Class 13 tranche of notes which are much lower risk priced at 3.5% which is the top of the launch guidance.Update, October 31st 2017:USAA’s losses from catastrophe events in the current risk period now put the riskiest Class 10 tranche of notes from this Residential Re 2014-1 catastrophe bond on watch for potential losses.USAA has reported a loss estimate of $147 million for hurricane Harvey and the mid-point of USAA’s initial estimated range of losses from hurricane Irma is $316 million, giving a $463 million total from the hurricane season, to-date.USAA has also reported its initial losses from the California wildfires, the mid-point of the per-occurrence range reported works out on an aggregate basis as $442 million, we’re told.Together, the losses from hurricanes and wildfires total a preliminary $905 million, which is just below the attachment point for the 2014-1 Class 10 notes of $910 million (a post-reset attachment point).The $80 million of Class 10 notes cover the majority share of a $100 million layer of USAA’s reinsurance program.Updates to loss estimates will change this and the notes will remain on risk until end of May 2018. That means there is plenty of time for the 2017/18 winterstorm season and 2018 convective storm season to add additional aggregate losses and cause payouts to this Class 10 tranche of notes.Update, March 23rd 2018: USAA’s aggregated losses from catastrophe events in the current risk period have now reached roughly $1 billion, suggesting that these 2014-1 Class 10 notes are triggered and if the estimates remain unchanged investors will face some losses. With some months left until the end of the risk period and the next reset, there is the potential for noteholders of this tranche to face a growing loss of principal.Update, August 29th 2018:The $80 million of Class 10 notes have had their maturity extended again to December 6th 2018.Update, Dec 5th, 2018:The $80 million of Class 10 notes have now been extended to March 6th 2019, to allow for further development of losses. These notes are priced for a total loss of principal in the secondary market.Update, June 4th 2019:It seems USAA has made a reinsurance recovery under this $80 million of Class 10 notes issued by ResRe 2014, as the net principal amount has now been reduced to zero. At the same time the maturity was extended to September 6th 2019.Update, September 3rd 2019:This cat bond had its maturity date, with principal recorded as “nil”, extended to December 6th 2019.Update, December 3rd 2019:This cat bond had its maturity date, with principal recorded as “nil”, extended to March 6th 2020.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

This is the first indemnity cat bond from Allstate, with the insurer previously preferring to use industry loss triggers for its group-wide protecting cat bonds.The $150m of Class A notes have an initial attachment probability of 0.99% and an expected loss of 0.78%. The two ceding insurers have different attachment points, we understand, with Castle Key Insurance set at just over $41m and Castle Key Indemnity at just over $30m.

The covered peril of earthquake includes damage caused by shaking from the quake itself, tidal wave, flood, fire following and sprinkler damage we understand.Nakama Re 2014-1 will provide Zenkyoren with reinsurance protection against earthquake losses using an indemnity trigger and on both a per-occurrence and annual aggregate basis, with each tranche of notes providing one type of cover. The term for this cat bond is almost four years, with maturity expected at the end of March 2018.The two tranches of notes cover the same 200 billion JPY layer of Zenkyoren’s reinsurance program, we understand, but one as per-occurrence and one aggregate protection. The attachment point is set at JPY 1,750,000,000,000 and the exhaustion point at 1,950,000,000,000.The Nakama Re 2014-1 cat bond has been cleverly structured so the aggregate tranche of notes features a deductible for each event, meaning that after one large quake the per-occurrence layer could be triggered and if it was large enough the aggregate too. However, a certain size of quake could trigger the per-occurrence layer but leave the aggregate with some principal left for aftershock of further events.A $150m Series 2014-1 Class 1 tranche of per-occurrence cat bond notes being issued by Nakama Re features an attachment probability of 0.85%, an exhaustion probability of 0.65% and an expected loss of 0.75%.A $50m Series 2014-1 Class 2 tranche of notes, which provide the annual aggregate protection, features an attachment probability of 0.85%, an exhaustion probability of 0.65% and an expected loss of 0.75%. This tranche of notes have a franchise deductible of JPY 270,000,000,000.In terms of price guidance there is not much to choose between the two tranches of notes. The Class 1 per-occurrence tranche of notes is being offered with guidance of 2.25% to 2.5% while the Class 2 tranche is offered with a range of 2.25% to 2.75%, we understand.Last years Nakama Re 2013 cat bond was slightly more risky with an expected loss of 0.9% but priced at 2.75%, so we would expect the pricing on Nakama Re 2014-1 to settle around the mid to lower end of the guidance ranges.The covered business under the Nakama Re 2014-1 cat bond is said to be homeowners and small commercial or industrial buildings, largely from Zenkyorens personal lines book of business.Update 1:The Nakama Re 2014-1 catastrophe bond had upsized by 50% to $300m in size, with each of the tranches of notes now $150m. At the same time the pricing on the per-occurrence tranche settled at the low-end of guidance, while the annual aggregate settled at the mid-point.The two tranches now look as follows.

"Aozora Re Ltd. (Series 2014-1)","Aozora Re Ltd. (Series 2014-1)","Sompo Japan and Nipponkoa Insurance Company","GC Securities is sole structuring agent and bookrunner.","AIR Worldwide","Japan typhoon","$100m (JPY10.125B)","Indemnity","S&P: Class B - ‘BB(sf)’","May 2014","The Aozora Re catastrophe bond is sponsored by primary insurers Sompo Japan and Nipponkoa Insurance Company, Artemis understands from market sources. The two insurers, which are both part of the NKSJ Holdings group, are set to merge to become a single entity named Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Insurance later this year. Both are first time catastrophe bond sponsors.Aozora Re will seek to issue two tranches of Series 2014-1 notes in this transaction, with one tranche denominated in USD and the other JPY. Artemis understands that whether both tranches are issued will ultimately depend on demand and appetite from investors. The different currencies used may suggest that the JPY tranche will be marketed to Japanese ILS investors, although some ILS managers do have JPY denominated funds now which could make this tranche targeted at them.Both tranches will be exposed to Japanese typhoon events and the resulting losses from wind, flood, surge, rain, hail or tornado damage. Both tranches will use an indemnity trigger and the reinsurance protection they provide will be on a per-occurrence basis over a slightly less than three-year period, until April 2017.Interestingly, sources told Artemis that both tranches of notes have the same risk profile, attaching at the same level and exhausting at the same level, so the main differences between them would appear to be the currency and also that the collateral of the USD tranche will be invested in U.S. treasury money market funds while the JPY tranche will be invested in Japanese Yen denominated money market funds. Again, that suggests the tranches will be marketed to different groups of investors.Both tranches of notes offered in this Aozora Re cat bond have an attachment probability of 0.57%, an exhaustion probability of 0.49% and the expected loss is 0.52%. The notes will attach at JPY 513,500,000,000 and the exhaustion is at 536,000,000,000, which is a layer of the sponsors reinsurance program sized around $230m.The Aozora Re cat bond will allow the sponsors to elect to perform a variable reset if they choose, where the expected loss has to be kept within certain predefined bounds and the coupon will be adjusted accordingly for investors.A Class A tranche of notes will be USD denominated and is marketed with price guidance of 2.25% to 2.65%. A Class B tranche of notes will be JPY denominated and features price guidance slightly higher at 2.3% to 2.7%. The JPY coupon may be higher purely for currency exchange reasons.Update 1:The publication of Standard & Poor’s presale report for this catastrophe bond raised some concerns and complexities in the transaction which are worth mentioning.The Aozora Re cat bonds modelling was performed using SJNK’s exposures as at 30th September 2012. S&P notes that it has been told that the subject business has not changed materially since that date, however that is quite a long period during which subtle changes may have occurred.S&P highlighted, as usual, a number of concerns with the cat bond transaction, however in this case they are a little more unusual than in other recent cat bonds to come to market.S&P said that around 13% (based on total insured value) of the exposures covered had an unknown location, that around 34% of the initial modeled loss is from industrial and commercial lines and that demand surge is not modelled. These factors could result in unexpected losses to NKSJ, outside of the expected losses from the modelling we would assume. It also suggests that certain exposures have not been modelled fully given their location was unknown.Mitigating factors noted by S&P include the fact that 66% of the expected loss contribution is from personal lines exposures and that there are no individual or groups of properties that create any concentration concern. Also that NKSJ will retain a percentage of the ultimate net losses for each covered event, thus reducing the potential impact to these cat bond notes.Another potential concern noted by S&P is that the AIR risk model used for this cat bond does not contain historical events after 2006. However only one event after that date, Typhoon Roke in 2011, has caused losses in excess of ¥3.8 billion. Losses from Roke totaled approximately ¥29 billion, according to S&P.Also, there have not been any typhoon events since 1947 that would have generated sufficient losses to reach the attachment point, said S&P. This is a remote risk, with a very high attachment point. 1959′s Typhoon Vera had the highest estimated ultimate net loss of ¥286.5 billion, however that number would need to increase by nearly 79% to reach the initial attachment level, and by 34% if the attachment was adjusted to the maximum under a variable reset. The next two events that generated the greatest ultimate net loss totals were 1961′s Typhoon Nancy and 1991′s Typhoon Mireille with loss amounts of ¥214.5 billion and ¥181.7 billion, respectively.On the subject business, S&P said:The subject business is a subset of the ceding insurer’s overall insurance portfolio and comprises fire insurance policies, movable-all risks (that is, property that can be moved outside of the insured premises) insurance policies, motor insurance policies, and engineering insurance policies. Motor insurance and fire insurance policies account for more than half of SJNK’s underwriting portfolio on a net premium income basis. All products cover typhoon and some products cover flood risks under standard policy forms. Losses related to movable-all risks, motor, and engineering insurance policies will only be covered under the reinsurance agreement by application of the adjustment factor.Fire insurance is subclassed into personal, commercial, and industrial subject business lines of business. Personal consists of policies covering residential dwellings and contents. Commercial consists of commercial policies covering stores and offices, etc., as well as equipment and products within such premises. Industrial consists of industrial policies covering buildings and factories, as well as equipment, devices, products, and other unfinished products within such premises.Also worth noting is that the region that contributes the most to expected losses is southern Japan, the area most prone to typhoon losses, with Fukuoka and Nagasaki prefectures contributing 19% of expected losses between them while Tokyo is just under 6%. Meanwhile wind contributes 90.8% of expected losses while flood only contributes 9.2%, on a building type basis dwellings are 41.3%, government housing loan scheme properties 24.6%, commercial 18.6% and industrial 15.5% of expected losses.S&P notes that while the Class A notes are US dollar denominated the sponsor will be retaining any currency risk between the conversion from ultimate net losses, which will be calculated in JPY and any loss to noteholders which will be in USD.The variable reset is worth noting as it allows the ceding insurer to adjust the modeled expected loss within a range of 0.52% to 1.04% at each reset date. S&P said that the probability of attachment based on the maximum expected loss is 1.15% and is the probability of attachment used to determine the nat-cat risk factor.Interestingly, S&P also said that at the variable reset the expected loss can increase from the initial level 0.52% to 0.70% without any increase to the risk interest spread, so investors may not be compensated for some increase in risk profile with this cat bond, an unusual feature. Should the expected loss increase above 0.70% then the risk spread will be adjusted accordingly.As a result of the first three concerns we mentioned above, the unknown location of some exposures, the industrial and commercial exposure and the lack of demand surge modelling, S&P said that it has adjusted the probability of attachment more than its rating criteria specifies to make allowance for these concerns and to derive its preliminary rating for the notes.Update 2:The Aozora Re cat bond has been cut down to a single tranche, with only the Japanese Yen denominated tranche B notes being issued.The deal is now said to be JPY 10 billion, which is just slightly under the $100m, meaning that the sponsor will likely receive the amount of cover it had been seeking.The Class B tranche has the same risk of attachment as the previously proposed Class A, so the sponsors are effectively receiving the same protection from the cat bond, just through a JPY tranche of notes instead.The Class B notes were launched with price guidance of 2.3% to 2.7%, which had been pitched 0.05% higher than the Class A notes despite having the same risk level. At the latest price guidance today Artemis understands that the range marketed has dropped down to 2% to 2.25%.Update 3:The Aozora Re catastrophe bond completed at JPY 10.125 billion, which is approximately $99.35m USD. The notes which had launched with price guidance of 2.3% to 2.7%, which subsequently dropped down to 2% to 2.25% last week, finally priced at the bottom end of the reduced guidance at 2%. This is the lowest ever coupon on a Japanese typhoon catastrophe bond, again demonstrating investors appetites for risk.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The earthquake protection is for the states of California, New York and Washington, Artemis understands.This transaction will see Sanders Re issue three tranches of Series 2014-1 notes, two tranches providing four years of cover and the third having a five-year term. All three tranches are exposed to both perils on a per-occurrence basis, with differing attachment probabilities and levels of expected loss.A $250m Class B tranche of notes, providing four years of protection, has an attachment probability of 0.81%, an expected loss of 0.72% and an exhaustion probability of 0.64%. The notes attach at reported index losses of $3.83 billion and exhaust at $4.18 billion.The $100m Class C tranche of notes, providing four years of protection, has an attachment probability of 0.97%, an expected loss of 0.87% and an exhaustion probability of 0.81%. These notes attach an index level of $3.499 billion with exhaustion set at $3.83 billion.The $250m Class D tranche, providing five years of protection, has an attachment probability of 1.27%, an expected loss of 1.13% and an exhaustion probability of 1.04%. These notes attach at reported index losses of $2.954 billion up to an exhaustion point of $3.436 billion.According to Artemis’ sources, Allstate may elect to issue a fourth Class A tranche of notes if the issuance is well received by investors. This Class A tranche, which we understand is not yet being marketed to investors, would sit below the Class B tranche with an initial expected loss of 0.61%. Of course that means that a $600m starting point for Sanders Re 2014-1 could be upsized considerably if Allstate chooses.But back to the three tranches which are being marketed right now. The Class B tranche of notes is being offered with initial guidance of a coupon range from 2.75% to 3%. The Class C tranche, which is slightly riskier, is being offered with a coupon range of 3% to 3.5%. The final Class D tranche, which is again holding slightly more risk, is offered at a range of 3.5% to 4%.Should the Class A tranche be launched it would likely be offered with pricing guidance slightly below the level of the Class B notes.We’re told that Aon Benfield Securities, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank are all providing joint structuring agent and bookrunner services, while AIR Worldwide is the risk modelling firm for this transaction.The Sanders Re 2013 cat bond is still in force for another three years, having had a four-year term, which means that if Sanders Re 2014-1 completes successfully at $600m or greater Allstate will have at least $950m of reinsurance protection in catastrophe bond form sourced from the capital markets.Update 1:Artemis understands that each tranche of notes may increase in size and they are now being marketed with a range of possible sizes, giving them room to upsize should investor demand support it.The Class B tranche of notes, providing four years of protection, which launched at $250m is now being marketed with a size range of $250m to $330m.The Class C tranche of notes, which also provide four years of protection, launched at $100m and is now said to be marketed with a range of $100m to $115m.Finally the Class D tranche, which has the five-year term, had launched at $250m and is now offered with a size range of $250m to $305m.So if all three of these tranches of Sanders Re 2014-1 cat bond notes were to grow to their maximum the deal would come in at $750m of cover for Allstate.The Class B tranche of notes launched with initial price guidance of 2.75% to 3%, but look set to price at the upper end at 3% we understand. The Class C tranche was offered with a coupon range of 3% to 3.5%, but will price right in the middle at 3.25%. Finally, the Class D tranche was offered at a range of 3.5% to 4%, but that has been narrowed and moved towards the upper end at 3.75% to 4%.Update 2:The Sanders Re 2014-1 cat bond did upsize to $750m and the pricing settled towards the top end of guidance on two tranches and at the mid-point on the third.Here is how the Sanders Re 2014-1 catastrophe bond looks after upsizing and final pricing:A Class B tranche of notes, providing four years of protection, which launched at $250m grew by 32% to $330m. Price wise, the Class B tranche of notes launched with initial price guidance of 2.75% to 3%, pricing settled at the upper end at 3%The Class C tranche of notes, which also provide four years of protection, launched at $100m and grew by 15% to $115m. The pricing for this tranche launched with a coupon range of 3% to 3.5%, but priced right in the middle at 3.25%.Finally the Class D tranche, which has a five-year term, launched at $250m but by close grew by 22% to $305m. The pricing on the Class D notes had launched with a guidance range of 3.5% to 4% but finally settled almost at the top end at 3.9%, Artemis understands.Update, July 2017The Class C tranche of notes had their rating upgraded to BB+, as the final reset was passed and no adjustment made to the notes expected loss.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The sale of the notes will be used to fully-collateralize a reinsurance agreement between Armor Re and the sponsor American Coastal Insurance, providing it with a source of capital markets backed reinsurance protection.The Armor Re 2014-1 cat bond will provide American Coastal Insurance with a source of reinsurance protection for losses to its commercial residential book of business from named storms (so tropical storms and hurricanes) over three U.S. hurricane seasons, with maturity slated for the end of 2016.The coverage will initially be for Florida only but the cat bond can be expanded to include coverage for other hurricane exposed states if the sponsor chooses to (a feature seen in the recent Citrus Re cat bond deals). It’s understood that the regions it can be expanded to are the U.S. states of Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas.The Armor Re 2014-1 cat bond will provide its protection to American Coastal using an indemnity trigger and on a per-occurrence basis. Artemis understands that the Armor Re 2014-1 cat bond notes will attach at $75m of losses to American Coastal Insurance above its other reinsurance coverages. That makes the effective attachment for a first event $984m of losses to the sponsor, but should reinsurance layers be eroded and not replaced beneath that level, then the attachment point could drop-down.The exhaustion point for the coverage provided by this cat bond cannot be less than $275m, which would suggest a $200m layer of protection so this cat bond may upsize to cover the whole layer.The attachment probability for the notes is said to be 0.6%, the exhaustion probability 0.39% and the expected loss 0.46%. The, currently $150m, series of 2014-1 notes being issued by Armor Re Ltd. are being marketed with initial price guidance of 3.5% to 4%.Update 1:The Armor Re 2014-1 cat bond upsized by 33% to $200m, thus covering the full layer of American Coastal’s reinsurance program as we suggested it might.At the same time the pricing settled at the upper end of guidance, at 4%, demonstrating that investors will not accept a risk at any cost.Investors told Artemis that the reinsurance layers sitting beneath the Armor Re 2014-1 cat bond do not feature reinstatements, meaning that should they be eroded the cat bond may effectively become increasingly risky if the layers were not replaced. This has resulted in a cautious approach to this deal, with investors seeking the assurance of a higher coupon.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Series 2014-1 Florida Citizens is seeking a fully-collateralized source of reinsurance protection against hurricanes, on an annual aggregate basis and using an indemnity trigger. The covered business is both personal and commercial residential policies from Florida Citizens coastal account.Artemis understands that the initial attachment point for this cat bond will be at $5.202 billion and the initial exhaustion point will be at $7.702 billion. Yes, that’s a $2.5 billion layer of Citizens reinsurance tower, so it will be interesting to see how large the 2014-1 Everglades Re issuance can grow to. Market sources suggest it is likely to increase in size beyond the $400m preliminary size being marketed, but how much is hard to predict.The initial attachment probability for the notes is 2.89%, the exhaustion probability is 1.72% and the expected loss is 2.3%. The transaction features a variable reset feature, we understand, which will see the attachment probability sit between 2.74% and 3.04% with investors being compensated with a variable interest coupon should it move at reset.We understand that the deal is being marketed with a preliminary price guidance range of 6.5% to 7.75%. That is significantly below Florida Citizens other cat bonds, Everglades Re 2012 priced at 17.75% while Everglades Re 2013 priced at 10%.While it is hard to compare per-occurrence and aggregate cat bonds on a risk basis, the 2014 pricing is very low for a deal which essentially sits at the same level in the reinsurance tower as the 2012 cat bond, while paying less than half the coupon.If you consider the fact that one large hurricane can wipe out a per-occurrence cat bond or an aggregate cat bond, that the attachment point is very similar and these cover the same layer, then Everglades 2014 could price as much as 60% cheaper than the 2012 deal.Once again this clearly demonstrates the reduction in cat bond rates seen in recent years. However, if you consider that year-on-year pricing has declined by 40% on some cat bonds, perhaps a two-year drop of 60% is reflective of investor appetite and recent pricing.It will be interesting to see who invests in this cat bond. The previous Everglades Re cat bonds have seen fixed income investors from outside the ILS space investing in the deals. It is possible that Citizens may be looking for significant support from these types of investors once again in 2014, especially if it wants to upsize it considerably.Standard & Poor’s has given the single tranche of Series 2014-1 notes to be issued by Everglades Re Ltd. a preliminary rating of ‘B(sf)’.Update 1:Everglades Re Ltd. (Series 2014-1), is set to become the largest single cat bond transaction ever having increased in size by a stunning 213% to reach $1.25 billion.The latest pricing guidance for the now $1.25 billion of cat bond notes has narrowed to 7.25% to 7.5%, we understand. So if the deal prices at 7.25% it would be just above the mid-point of the launch guidance, or at 7.5% it would actually be slightly more towards the upper end of the launch guidance.Update 2:The Everglades Re 2014-1 catastrophe bond grew in size again before close, reaching another record at $1.5 billion.At the same time the pricing settled at the upper end of the narrowed range, at 7.5%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The 2014-2 notes have an attachment probability of 1.1%, an exhaustion probability of 0.9% and an expected loss of 1.04%.As with the earlier series of notes, 2014-2 also has the ability to add extra U.S. states to the covered area at the annual reset, giving Heritage the chance to protect risks outside of Florida and perhaps also acting as a capital source to help it to expand into new areas if it chose. The notes also feature a variable reset feature allowing it to be reset within a range of expected losses.The $50m (currently) Citrus Re 2014-2 cat bond notes are being offered with a coupon price guide range of 3.75% to 4%, Artemis understands. The 2014-1 series of notes eventually priced at a reduced 4.25%, so this new tranche looks to have been priced to sell and while the pricing may decline before it completes, we wouldn’t expect it to drop as far as the previous tranche.Update 1:The Citrus Re 2014-2 cat bond remained at $50m in size. The $100m layer of Heritage’s reinsurance program sees it sit alongside some private reinsurance cover so it does not cover a full 50% of those losses.The pricing settled at the low end of the launch range at 3.75%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

At launch the cat bond is being marketed as a $250m transaction split evenly between the two tranches of notes, Artemis understands.This 2014-1 cat bond from Kilimanjaro Re will provide Everest Re with per-occurrence and annual aggregate U.S. named storm protection and aggregate U.S. earthquake protection as well. Protection will be afforded on an industry loss basis, using a PCS index weighted by territory for both the per-occurrence and aggregate for each peril.The $125m Class A tranche of notes is targeting per-occurrence coverage for U.S. named storms in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and South Carolina, using a weighted PCS industry loss trigger. This tranche of notes has an attachment probability of 2.24%, an exhaustion probability of 1.14% and an expected loss of 1.6%, we understand. The attachment point for the Class A notes is at an industry index level of $1.4 billion while the exhaustion is at an industry index level of $2.15 billion.The $125m Class B notes target annual aggregate protection for U.S. named storms across a wider area of all U.S. Gulf and East coast states as well as aggregate earthquake protection across all the most exposed states in the U.S. This tranche has an attachment probability of 2.18%, an exhaustion probability of 0.94% and an expected loss of 1.46%. The attachment point is set at an industry index level of $2.15 billion while this tranche exhausts at an index level of $2.9 billion. It is understood that the Class B tranche features a franchise deductible of $110m per event.Interestingly, rating agency Standard & Poor’s said that; “If PCS fails to supply the necessary information and a replacement is found, the epicenter of an earthquake does not have to be within the covered area, but if an earthquake results in spectral acceleration of at least 0.084g in the covered area, then losses related to this earthquake will be covered.”The Class A notes are predominantly exposed to Florida for named storms. Florida contributes 92.5% of the expected losses for this tranche of notes, which as good as makes the tranche a Florida wind cat bond.The Class B notes are more evenly exposed, with 73.8% of the tranches expected losses attributable to named storms, 26.5% being Florida wind, 12.2% being Texas, 5.6% New York and 4% Massachusetts. Of the remaining 26.2% of expected losses which makes up the earthquake exposure in the Class B tranche of notes, 18.7% is California quake risk.As a result of this exposure base the main risk facing investors in the Kilimanjaro Re cat bond appears to be from a Florida category 4 or 5 hurricane.S&P also noted that based on risk modeller AIR’s analysis there has been one named storm event, the unnamed hurricane of 1926 that made landfall in Florida and Alabama, that would have resulted in a lost to the class A note holders. Losses from this event would have resulted in a full loss of principal. The next three most-damaging events were the 1928 unnamed storm that made landfall in Florida, 1992’s Hurricane Andrew, and the unnamed storm of 1947 that made landfall in Florida and Louisiana. Modeled losses from these events were $1.32 billion, $1.27 billion, and $1.20 billion, respectively.For the Class B notes, only the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 would have resulted in a loss to the class B note holders. The modeled loss from this event would have resulted in an 81% principal reduction. The next three most-damaging event years were 2005 (hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma) with $1.99 billion in estimated losses, 1926 (one unnamed hurricane) with $1.61 billion, and 1886 (Charleston S.C. earthquake) with $1.15 billion.S&P also note that the AIR U.S. Hurricane Model does not model the probability of losses resulting from tropical storms that at no point are classified as a hurricane, hurricanes that degrade to tropical storm force and subsequently make landfall in the U.S. as tropical storms, or storms that never make landfall in the U.S. that fail to cause winds of greater than or equal to 74 miles per hour over any part of the U.S.However, S&P said that Everest Re reports that it is not aware of any events that were named storms but not hurricanes when they made landfall that would have caused losses in excess of $110 million, the initial franchise deductible amount.In terms of price guidance, the Class A per-occurrence notes are being offered to investors with an interest spread coupon of 5.25% to 5.75%. The Class B aggregate notes are being offered with an interest spread coupon of 5% to 5.5%.Update 1:Sources said that the Kilimanjaro Re cat bond has seen robust investor demand leading to it being oversubscribed and as a result the deal has been lifted from the $250m it launched at to now offer $450m of notes.The Class A tranche of notes has doubled in size from $125m to $250m Artemis understands.The Class B tranche of notes has grown from $125m to now stand at $200m in size.At the same time the pricing has been lowered on both tranches, once again providing a demonstration of where U.S. property catastrophe reinsurance and retrocession rates are likely headed at the mid-year renewals.The Class A per-occurrence notes price guidance was lowered down to a range of 4.75% to 5.25%, so below the original range.The Class B aggregate notes price guide range was lowered down to a range of 4.5% to 5%.Update 2:Both tranches of notes priced at the low end of the already reduced ranges.The pricing guidance for the Class A per-occurrence notes started at 5.25% to 5.75%, but was subsequently lowered down to a range of 4.75% to 5.25%, so below the original range. At final pricing Artemis understands that these $250m of Class A notes will pay investors a coupon of 4.75%, right at the lowest end of the reduced range. That’s a drop in pricing of around 16% from the mid-point of the launch guidance.The Class B annual aggregate notes were initially offered with an interest spread coupon of 5% to 5.5%, which subsequently dropped to 4.5% to 5%. The pricing on this $200m tranche of notes finished again at the lowest end of the reduced range, offering investors a coupon of 4.5%. That’s a price reduction of almost 17% from the mid-point of the launch guidance range.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Aon Benfield Securities is joint bookrunner","RMS","European windstorm","€190m ($262m)","Indemnity","Fitch  'B+sf'","Apr 2014","Lion I Re Ltd., an Irish domiciled special purpose reinsurance vehicle, is set to issue a single tranche of notes which are being marketed with a preliminary size of €150m. With this issuance, the sponsor Assicurazioni Generali is seeking a fully-collateralized source of multi-year reinsurance protection against European windstorms.The Lion I Re cat bond notes will provide Assicurazioni Generali with protection against European windstorms on an indemnity and per-occurrence basis. It’s encouraging to see that this cat bond uses an indemnity trigger as it is only the second to do so for the peril of European windstorm after the Windmill I Re Ltd. cat bond deal.The Lion I Re notes will provide protection over a 3 year risk period and cover losses from European windstorms across Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.The trigger point for the protection is at €400m of losses and the exhaustion point is at €800m, Artemis understands, which could suggest a possibility of the deal upsizing significantly if Generali chose to fill that entire layer of its reinsurance with the Lion I Re cat bond.That equates to an attachment probability of 2.1%, an exhaustion probability of 0.45% and an expected loss of 1%. The €150m of notes were initially marketed with price guidance of 2.5% to 3% it is understood.The Lion I Re cat bond structure allowed Generali to access the cat bond market outside of its traditional reinsurance cycle while not being penalised for this by paying any excess premium. The cat bond has been cleverly arranged to allow Generali to continue to benefit from paying premiums calculated on an annual basis.GC Securities highlighted another interesting first for this cat bond. A new feature which allows a sponsor to access the capital markets paying an annual premium rate. This allows the cedent to step out of its typical reinsurance renewal cycle to take advantage of opportunities in the capital market. It also likely enables the cat bond to be better embedded within the reinsurance program of the cedent, certainly making accounting for the cat bond a more simple task.Cory Anger, Global Head of ILS Structuring at GC Securities, explained; “In addition to being the first indemnity triggered 144A Europe windstorm catastrophe bond and incorporating the latest structural features of the cat bond market, Lion I Re pioneers a new methodology to allow cedents to access the capital markets at any point the during calendar year but only pay an annual premium rate that adjusts to reflect the commensurate amount of risk contributed for such portion of a partial calendar year period. Such a feature opens the ability for cedents to access capital markets protection at a different time than their traditional renewal without paying excess premium.”Fitch highlights though that over 80% of the cat bonds exposure is located in three countries, Germany, France and Austria. Fitch also notes that the subject business covered by Lion I Re is primarily residential (70%) and commercial (21%) with a modest amount of industrial property covered.Fitch provides some insight into the Lion I Re cat bond reset mechanism and terms, which includes a variable reset facility allowing Generali to adjust the expected loss within pre-defined boundaries.Fitch explains; “Generali has the option to increase the subject business by 1.10 during any risk period. On each reset date, the attachment point and probability of exhaustion will be set to keep the modeled expected loss risk at 1.00%. Generali may exercise the option to adjust the expected loss in the second or third risk periods such that it falls in the range between 0.75% and 1.25%. If this occurs, the risk interest spread will be recalculated to reflect the marginal increase or decrease to the level of risk assumed by the noteholders. As the three risk periods are of unequal length, the risk interest spread will be multiplied by 0.72 and 1.54 in the first and third risk periods, corresponding to shorter and longer risk periods.”Fitch highlights that while this is an indemnity cat bond there is some basis risk due to an element of the risk covered not being modelled, saying; “Risks that were not modeled by RMS included: the growth allowance of 1.10, storm surge (except for the west coast of U.K.), flood damage, hail damage, crop damage and currency exchange.”Fitch notes that it is the investors who will be exposed to this basis risk between the actual net losses that Generali experiences and the modelled loss information provided by risk modeller RMS.Update 1:The €150m tranche of notes has upsized and is expected to complete around €180m to €190m in size, a possible increase of 27%.At the same time the price guidance has been reduced. The Lion I Re cat bond was initially marketed with a coupon price range of 2.5% to 3% but that range has been narrowed and lowered to below the bottom of that range, with the notes now offered with a coupon of 2.25% to 2.5%. If it prices at the bottom of the reduced range, at 2.25%, it would be a reduction in price of 18% from the middle of the original guidance.Update 2:Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. successfully closed the Lion I Re Limited cat bond to secure itself €190m of fully-collateralized European windstorm reinsurance protection at keen pricing.At pricing and closing the Lion I Re cat bond notes settled to offer investors a yield of 2.25%, which is a drop of 18% in pricing from the mid-point of initial guidance.Update 3 (5th May 2015):At the reset the variable reset was used to allow the property exposures within the covered portfolio to be updated slightly.Back in December, risk modeller RMS reported that the attachment probability had risen from the initial 2.1% to 2.32% for the risk period Jan. 1, 2015 through Dec. 31, 2015. This updated probability reflects updated property exposures within the Subject Business in the Covered Area that have been run through the escrowed RMS model, Fitch explained.As a result the expected loss has increased slightly to 1.09% from 1%, which results in an update to the risk interest spread as well, to 2.36% which is a very slight increase on the 2.25% the Lion I Re cat bond launched with. The trigger and exhaustion points of €400m and €800m remain unchanged, Fitch said.As a result of the change in attachment probability Fitch reassessed the notes to check that the rating it had given at launch could be maintained. Fitch confirmed that it still corresponds to an implied rating of ‘B+’, so no change required.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The single tranche of notes are being marketed with a preliminary size of $100m and the proceeds of their sale will collateralize a reinsurance contract to protect Heritage against named storm risks.The Citrus Re cat bond transaction will provide Heritage with a three-year, fully-collateralized source of reinsurance against named storms (so tropical storms and hurricanes) initially in Florida but with the ability to expand the coverage to include more hurricane exposed U.S. states after the annual reset, Artemis understands.Heritage is a relatively new insurance company which was established to takeout policies from Florida’s Citizens Property Insurance Corp. as part of the efforts to lower the risks of the states insurer of last resort. So Heritage may seek to expand outside of Florida in years to come, hence the Citrus Re cat bond will allow it to add in more U.S. states under the coverage in years to come if required.But for launch the Citrus Re cat bond will be the first pure Florida wind cat bond to come to market in 2014.The Citrus Re cat bond notes provide protection to Heritage using an indemnity trigger which will be calculated on a per-occurrence basis. The notes have an attachment point of $200m and an exhaustion point of $350m, which perhaps suggests that the size of this deal may grow from the initial $100m to cover the full $150m layer.The initial probability of attachment for the Citrus Re cat bond notes is 1.66%, the initial exhaustion probability is 1.1% and the initial expected loss is set at 1.28%.Artemis understands that the $100m of Series 2014-1 notes being marketed under the Citrus Re Ltd. catastrophe bond are currently being offered with price guidance of 4.75% to 5.5% above the yield of the collateral investments.Update 1:The Citrus Re catastrophe bond grew in size to $150m while marketing.At the same time the price guidance was lowered to below the original range and narrowed so that the Citrus Re notes were offered at an interest spread range of 4.25% to 4.75%.Update 2:At final pricing the Citrus Re cat bond priced at the bottom of that reduced range, offering investors an interest coupon of 4.25%.

This is the insurers first visit to the capital markets to issue a catastrophe bond.Riverfront Re Ltd. is a Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurer registered in late-January for the purpose of issuing series of catastrophe bond notes. In this first issuance for Great American Insurance, Riverfront Re Ltd. is proposing the issue of a single $95m Series 2014-1 tranche of notes.The notes will provide Great American and subsidiaries with a multi-year source of fully-collateralized reinsurance protection against the perils of named storms, earthquakes including fire following, severe thunderstorms and winter storms in the U.S. and Canada.The protection runs for almost three years with maturity of the Riverfront Re bonds due at the end of December 2016.The covered area for named storms (so tropical storms and hurricanes) are the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Hawaii, District of Columbia, and Canada.The covered area for the remaining perils, earthquakes (including fire following), severe thunderstorms, and winter storms, is for all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Canada.The Riverfront Re cat bond transaction is using catastrophe designation from Property Claim Services (PCS) for severe thunderstorm and winters storm losses. For these perils to qualify as covered events the catastrophe event must be assigned a catastrophe code by PCS, which would require the event to have caused an estimated $25m or more of insurance industry losses. Named storms are designated by the National Hurricane Centre and earthquakes by the USGS.Ratings agency Standard & Poor’s said that the Riverfront Re cat bond will cover Great American Insurance and its named subsidiaries losses on a per-occurrence basis from an attachment point of $100m up to an exhaustion point of $200m.The covered layer under the cat bond protection is $100m in size but the sponsor will retain a 5% share of the ultimate net losses from any covered events (hence the $95m protection).The ultimate cedents, or beneficiaries of the reinsurance protection, will be Great American Insurance Co.; American Empire Surplus Lines Insurance Co.; American Empire Insurance Co.; Mid-Continent Casualty Co.; Mid-Continent Assurance Co.; Mid-Continent Excess and Surplus Insurance Co., Mid-Continent Specialty Insurance Services Inc.; and Oklahoma Surety Co, according to S&P. Great American Insurance will act as agent of the ceding companies and will be responsible for sending and receiving notices of losses and receiving or remitting payments.The attachment probability for the notes is 1.99%, the exhaustion probability is 0.61% and the expected loss is 1.1%.The majority of the expected losses within the Riverfront Re cat bond are from named storms, we understand. The U.S. states contributing the largest portion of the expected losses are Florida, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Texas, predominantly from named storm risk.Once again this new cat bond contains an element of unmodelled risk, according to Standard & Poor’s, for example the covered business includes equine mortality risks and trucking risks which are unmodelled. It is also worth noting that the cat bond covers predominantly commercial exposures and includes agricultural risks and inland marine which can be harder to model losses for.Based on modelling of historical loss events, RMS found that only one hurricane event would have caused a loss to holders of the Riverfront Re cat bond notes. The ‘Northeast Clipper’ storm of 1938 generated an ultimate net loss of $122.6m which would have eroded some of the investors principal. The next largest events were the 1811 New Madrid Earthquake and the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane, which resulted in ultimate net losses of $84.2m and $69.8m, respectively.The $95m tranche of Series 2014-1 Riverside Re Ltd. cat bond notes are being marketed to investors with a coupon guide range of 4.25% to 5%.Update 1:Artemis understands that guidance has now been lowered and tightened and the notes are now being offered with a price range of 4% to 4.25%.For Great American Insurance, should the notes price at the bottom of the new range at 4%, it would represent a saving of around 13.5% from the mid-point of initial guidance, making the transaction particularly effective on a cost basis.Update 2:The Riverfront Re cat bond finally priced at the bottom of the reduced range with a coupon to investors of 4% (400bps) above the collateral investment yield.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

State Farm is seeking three years of protection from the Merna Re V catastrophe bond, with it said to mature at the end of March 2017.The earthquake cover is for Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin, which are the U.S. states situated around the New Madrid earthquake fault. State Farm has protection for the same region from its Merna Re IV Ltd. which was issued in April 2013.We’re told that the layer of coverage included in Merna Re V is very similar to the Merna Re IV cat bond, with the attachment point being the same, at $450m of ultimate net losses and the exhaustion point being at $1.45 billion. The transaction has an attachment probability of 0.56%, an exhaustion probability of 0.32% and an expected loss of 0.41%. These are all very close to the figures in last years State Farm cat bond deal.The majority of the risk covered by Merna Re V will be personal lines homeowner property policies, we understand, with some commercial property included as well. The indemnity protection for claims arising from earthquakes in the covered area also includes fire following. Risk modelling for the transaction has been undertaken by RMS, Artemis understands.The Merna Re V Ltd. cat bond notes are being marketed with price guidance of 2% to 2.5%, we’re told. Given the similarities between the expected loss of Merna Re V and last years Merna Re IV, as well as the identical attachment points it’s worth noting that Merna Re IV priced at 2.5%.This suggests that if State Farm can secure the cover from Merna Re V at the lower end of the marketed range at 2% it could represent a 20% saving over the deal from the previous year. That is inline with the amount that U.S. property catastrophe rates on ILS have dropped over the last year.Update 1:Artemis understands that price guidance has now been lowered to the bottom of that range with the notes now offered with pricing of 2%.That is a 20% decline in the coupon offered during the marketing of Merna Re V, from the top end of the original range or 11% from the mid-point, taking the pricing multiple down to approximately 4.88 times expected losses.The Merna Re IV cat bond, which completed almost a year ago, priced at 2.5% (so 20% higher) for an almost identical level of risk. The multiple of coupon to expected loss for last years Merna Re IV was higher at 6.25 times, demonstrating the increased ability and appetite of cat bond investors to take on more risk for lower return due to their lower cost of capital.Update 2:At final pricing the coupon for the $300m of notes offered by Merna Re V Ltd. was fixed at the lowest end, at 2%.This is now the lowest yielding pure quake cat bond in the markets history.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Chubb is seeking a four-year source of fully-collateralized reinsurance protection for the perils of U.S. named storms, earthquakes (including fire following and sprinkler leakage, both which are included in the modelling), severe thunderstorms and winter storms.The transaction is being marketed with a preliminary size of $225m, but that could grow if investor demand is high and pricing deemed attractive.A single Series 2014-1 Class A tranche of notes is proposed, with the $225m of notes being sold to collateralize a reinsurance contract protecting Chubb from these U.S. perils on a per-occurrence basis.The cat bond will utilise an indemnity trigger with the protection being for a selection of Chubb’s personal and commercial property exposures.The actual cedent for the East Lane Re VI cat bond is a range of Chubb group companies, while Chubb & Son is described as the sponsor of the transaction.The protection benefits a variety of Chubb companies, including; Federal Insurance Co., Vigilant Insurance Co., Chubb Insurance Co. of New Jersey, Chubb National Insurance Co., Chubb Indemnity Insurance Co., Great Northern Insurance Co., Pacific Indemnity Co., Executive Risk Indemnity Inc., Executive Risk Specialty Insurance Co., Chubb Custom Insurance Co., Texas Pacific Indemnity Co., and Chubb Lloyd’s Insurance Co. of Texas.The covered area for the cat bond is the following U.S states; Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.In terms of the contribution to expected losses, named storm risk makes up the bulk (88.7%) of it given that the covered area is not one which has experienced major insurance industry losses from earthquakes. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts contribute 88% of the expected losses to the deal, with New York 42.7% of expected losses alone.Covered losses under the East Lare Re VI cat bond are for personal lines and commercial lines property exposures. S&P notes the following on the mix of business covered; “Chubb primarily markets its personal-lines policies to high-net-worth individuals and is well known for insuring high–value homes, auto, and other properties. The company has also established a presence in the standard commercial market where it writes commercial multiperil, workers’ compensation, umbrella liability, and other casualty, property, and marine policies Its specialty commercial products include directors and officers, errors and ommissions, and surety policies.”East Lane Re VI contains a balanced mix of personal and commercial risks, with commercial exposures contributing 40.7% of expected losses for the cat bond, according to S&P. A portion of the exposures covered by the cat bond are unmodelled, these are primarily within Chubb’s commercial property book or in package forms that fall under a bundle of additional coverages which are included, said S&P.The East Lane Re VI Series 2014-1 catastrophe bond notes have an attachment point of $3 billion of losses to Chubb companies and an exhaustion point at $3.3 billion.S&P noted that when RMS performed an analysis of historical catastrophe events, the three historical events that generated the highest modelled losses were; the 1938 unnamed hurricane that made landfall in New York ($2.887 billion), the 1954 Hurricane Carol ($1.265 billion), and the 2012 Hurricane Sandy ($1.104 billion).There are no historical loss events, which were modelled by RMS as part of the issuing this transaction, which would have breached the $3 billion attachment point it appears. Also if you look at Chubb’s largest natural catastrophe insured loss, which was hurricane Katrina, it comes nowhere near to the attachment point.The attachment probability is 0.87%, the expected loss 0.82% and the exhaustion point 0.77%.The transaction will feature a variable reset feature, allowing it to be reset with different attachment and exhaustion, as long as the expected loss remains within a range of 0.75% to 1%. The coupon paid to investors would be adjusted accordingly, commensurate with any change in risk.The transaction is being marketed with a proposed coupon guidance range of 3% to 3.75%.Update 1:The size of the East Lane Re VI cat bond is likely to increase with the cat bond now being offered with a range suggested, of $225m to $270m as investor demand looks set to help Chubb grow its sixth cat bond. Given the attractive issuance conditions in the cat bond market it wouldn’t be surprising to see Chubb go even bigger with this deal if investor oversubscription helps them secure a larger amount of cover.The pricing has now been lowered and narrowed to 2.75% to 3%, enabling Chubb to secure this cat bond protection at a significantly lower coupon than initial expectations. If it prices at the low end of this reduced range it would represent a saving of nearly 19% from the mid-point of the initial range.Update 2:Chubb successfully secured the maximum size of $270m for East Lane Re VI, while at the same time securing the largest saving in terms of the coupon it will pay to investors as the cat bond notes priced at the lowest end of the reduced range at 2.75%.That means that the East Lane Re VI catastrophe bond has increased in size by 20% while marketing and the pricing has dropped by nearly 19%, if calculated from the mid-point of the initial coupon guidance range.The East Lane Re VI Ltd. principal at-risk variable rate note program and the $270m Series 2014-1 tranche of variable rate cat bond notes have been admitted for listing on the Cayman Islands Stock Exchange.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Gator Re Ltd.","Gator Re Ltd.","American Strategic Insurance Group","Willis Capital Markets & Advisory are sole structurer and bookrunner","AIR Worldwide","U.S. named storms and severe thunderstorm","$200m","Indemnity","?","Mar 2014","The Gator Re cat bond sees Florida-based primary insurance group American Strategic Insurance seeking a multi-year, fully-collateralized source of reinsurance protection from capital markets investors through the sale of a single tranche of Series 2014-1 cat bond notes. The deal is being marketed with a preliminary size of $125m.The Series 2014-1 notes issued by Gator Re, a Bermuda domiciled SPI, will be sold to collateralize reinsurance contracts providing American Strategic Insurance and some named subsidiaries with fully-collateralized protection for U.S. named storms (so tropical storms and hurricanes) and U.S. severe thunderstorm risks.The Gator Re cat bond is an indemnity transaction, so providing cover for the actual losses that American Strategic Insurance suffers. The term for the Gator Re cat bond will be approximately 2 years 9 months, with maturity scheduled for the end of December 2016.The cover is split into two sections. The first is exposed to U.S. named storms and severe thunderstorms on a per occurrence and indemnity basis, the second is exposed to just severe thunderstorms on an annual aggregate and indemnity basis. Both of these sections share the limit of the Series 2014-1 notes.Named storm coverage is for the typical U.S. states affected by hurricanes and tropical storms, east coast, Gulf coast and Florida, while severe thunderstorm coverage is for the 48 U.S. contiguous states and the District of Columbia.The per-occurrence layer, referred to as Section A, has an attachment point of $40m and an exhaustion point of $240m. The aggregate layer, referred to as Section B, has an attachment point of $150m and an exhaustion point of $350m. With the layer being $200m in size it would not be surprising if the Gator Re cat bond upsized to $200m by close.It would seem that the Gator Re cat bond will give American Strategic Insurance protection both for major losses from named storms and thunderstorms, through the per-occurrence layer, while an accumulation of attritional thunderstorm losses across an annual risk period will be covered in the aggregate layer’s protection.The Gator Re notes have an attachment probability of 4.87%, an expected loss of 1.5% and an exhaustion probability of 0.58% at launch. Projected figures have also been calculated based on how American Strategic Insurance’s portfolio may look later in 2014, which sees the attachment probability rise to 6.47% and the expected loss to 1.76%.The Gator Re Series 2014-1 notes are being marketed with pricing guidance of 7% to 7.75% Artemis understands.Update 1:Artemis understands that thanks to strong investor demand, as expected this cat bond has been oversubscribed at its initial size like almost every other, the Gator Re cat bond is now being pitched at $200m in size, a 60% upsizing.At the same time, again as expected in the current cat bond issuance environment, the price guidance has been reduced for the deal. When it launched, Gator Re was being marketed with pricing guidance of 7% to 7.75% but this has now dropped to below that range and narrowed to guidance of 6.5% to 7%.If the deal prices at the lower end of that reduced range, which based on all recent cat bonds is highly possible, then the drop in pricing American Strategic Insurance benefits from could be as high as 12% (from the mid-point of the original guidance range).The Gator Re cat bonds risk period has also been clarified. The per-occurrence layer, understood to be referred to as Section A, risk period will run from 1st June 2014 to 31st December 2016, so providing reinsurance protection for three U.S. wind seasons.

That is a 12% reduction in pricing from the mid-point of the originally marketed range.Update December 2016:Qualifying estimated losses for the Gator Re catastrophe bond reached $195 million at the end of November 2016, when the re-set attachment point was just $175 million, suggesting a $20 million loss of principal to investors.The Gator Re cat bond note priced down in the secondary market and an extension event notice was served, in order to allow loss development to be finalised before any final loss total would be revealed to investors in the notes.Update January 2017:An extension notice has been filed for the stricken Gator Re Ltd. catastrophe bond transaction that suggests a partial repayment event and retention of $35 million, which is higher than the figure anticipated after the November loss report was released, providing a buffer for further development.Update November 2017:The Gator Re cat bond has finally been matured, as of the 7th November and its notes delisted. This means the final principal was likely paid out to American Strategic at that time.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Kizuna Re II Ltd.","Kizuna Re II Ltd.","Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co. Ltd.","Aon Benfield Securities are sole structuring agent and bookrunner","AIR Worldwide","Japan earthquake","$245m","Indemnity","?","Mar 2014","Kizuna Re II Ltd. is a Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurance vehicle, registered in January for the purpose of issuing series of catastrophe bond notes. In this issuance two tranches of Series 2014-1 notes are being marketed to investors, both being sold to collateralize reinsurance agreements to provide Tokio Marine with a source of Japanese earthquake protection.Both of the tranches of notes will provide Tokio Marine with a source of indemnity based reinsurance protection, Artemis understands, with a Class A tranche of notes being marketed at a size of $160m and a Class B tranche at $40m.Given the diversifying nature of a Japanese quake cat bond it would not be surprising to see this transaction grow in size, as investors are likely to show strong support for a true opportunity to add diversification to their cat bond portfolios.The earthquake cover afforded to Tokio Marine by the Kizuna Re II cat bond will cover all Japanese territories, be on a per-occurrence basis and the indemnity trigger will be based on the insurers ultimate net losses from earthquake events. The Kizuna Re II cat bond will run for a four-year term.The $160m tranche of Series 2014-1 Class A notes have an attachment probability of 0.41%, an expected loss of 0.21% and a probability of exhaustion of 0.06%. The attachment point for these notes is set at JPY 180 billion, which is around $1.77 billion and the exhaustion point is JPY 310 billion.The $40m tranche of Series 2014-1 Class B notes have an attachment probability of 0.85%, an expected loss of 0.57% and a probability of exhaustion of 0.41%, making these notes the more risky of the two layers. The attachment point for these notes is set at JPY 120 billion, which is around $1.18 billion and the exhaustion point is JPY 180 billion.The transaction features an initial short loss period, which we understand is being termed a stub period, running until the 31st March 2014, where the attachment point for the Class A notes is much higher, at JPY 310 billion. The Class B notes do not have this stub period.The cat bond transaction features a flexible reset mechanism, allowing the deal to be reset within a range of expected loss, with the maximum expected loss that each class of notes can be reset to fixed at 0.3% for the Class A notes and 0.7% for Class B. This gives some flexibility in terms of where the cover sits within Tokio Marine’s reinsurance tower.The Class A notes are being marketed to investors with a price guide of 2.25% to 2.5% and the Class B notes have price guidance of 2.75% to 3.25%.Update 1:Pricing guidance was lowered and narrowed as the Kizuna Re II cat bond came to market.The latest price guidance shows the Class A tranche now offered with a coupon of 2.25% and the Class B tranche of notes now offered with a coupon range of 2.5% to 2.75%.Update 2:Artemis understand that the Class A tranche has now been increased in size to $200m, while the Class B tranche has been upsized by just $5m to $45m in size. That’s an increase in deal size of almost 23%.The Class A tranche, now $200m in size, launched with price guidance of 2.25% to 2.5%. The price guidance was reduced to the bottom of the range, with the Class A tranche offered with a coupon of 2.25% last week. The final pricing has settled at that low end of a 2.25% interest coupon to be paid to investors, possibly the lowest spread for Japanese earthquake risk in the cat bond markets history.Meanwhile the Class B tranche of notes, now $45m in size, which launched with a price guide range of 2.75% to 3.25% which was then lowered to below the bottom end of that range, with the notes offered with a coupon range of 2.5% to 2.75% las week. These notes have now priced at the low end of the reduced range with an interest coupon of 2.5%, again very low for Japanese quake risk.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Dodeka II","Dodeka II","Unknown","?","?","U.S. named storm and U.S. earthquake","$25m","Industry loss index","NR","Feb 2014","Dodeka II, issued by Twelve Capital on behalf of an unnamed cedent, is a $25m zero-coupon bond that expires in December 2014, so covering approximately six and a half months. The deal covers U.S. wind and earthquake risks and the trigger is an industry loss with reporting provided by Property Claim Services (PCS).The novel deal covers second event risk, with two trigger scenarios arranged in a unique structure. The first trigger scenario being the occurrence of an earthquake within the first 3 months of the deal and at least one windstorm over duration of the bond. The second trigger scenario is the occurrence of at least two U.S. windstorms over the duration of the bond up to the maturity date.Twelve Capital said that the unique structure adds a new element to the catastrophe bond market. The firm explained; “This structure is unique given it combines two different type of events corresponding to two specific time segments. It enriches the liquid cat bond space by adding alternative to the limited second event cat bond capacity.”Twelve Capital said that the private catastrophe bond structure is playing an increasingly important role within Twelve Capital’s work. These deals, Dodeka II is the second following Dodeka I which was issued in January, are helping Twelve Capital to extend the range of insurance linked investment opportunities within the firms portfolios.“We have a great network in the (re)insurance sector, and we have the in-house expertise to transfer insurance risk into liquid niche transactions of a manageable size,” commented Dr. Roman Muraviev, Director at Twelve Capital.The Dodeka II cat bond was issued using the Kane SAC Limited private cat bond platform, which is operated by global independent insurance manager Kane. As with the first Dodeka deal, this latest issuance has had the notes issued on the Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX) thus enhancing the notes liquidity and giving Twelve Capital improved options and transparency to trade the notes on the secondary market.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

GC Securities are sole bookrunner","AIR Worldwide","U.S. hurricane, Australia cyclone","$100m","Industry loss index and modelled industry loss index","?","Feb 2014","Queen Street IX Re Limited is an Irish domiciled special purpose reinsurance vehicle, interesting as Munich Re’s Queen Street cat bonds have tended to be Bermuda domiciled in the past. The vehicle will issue a single tranche of catastrophe bond notes for the purpose of collateralizing a retrocessional reinsurance contract for Munich Re. The deal is not being marketed with a preliminary size, Artemis understands, so at the moment it is not known how large this cat bond could become.The reinsurance protection provided by Queen Street IX Re will be on a per-occurrence basis over just more than three years. The risk period for U.S. hurricane events will run from March 1st 2014 to December 1st 2016, while for Australian cyclones the risk period will run from March 1st 2014 to May 31st 2017.Both of the covered perils will use a type of industry loss index trigger. The trigger for U.S. hurricane risks is a county and line of business weighted PCS industry loss index, while the trigger for Australian cyclone risks is a post-code and line of business weighted modelled industry loss index.The attachment, exhaustion and expected loss for the notes are identical to Munich Re’s Queen Street VIII cat bond, coming in with an attachment probability of 3.91%, an exhaustion probability of 1.88% and an expected loss of 2.72%. Australian cyclone risks contribute just over half (56%) of the expected loss of the cat bond, at 1.51% compared to 1.23% for U.S. hurricane risks.One difference between this Queen Street IX Re cat bond and Munich Re’s previous Queen Street VIII Re deal is the pricing guidance. Despite the fact that the risk levels are identical the price guidance on Queen Street IX Re is lower from the launch. The Queen Street IX Re cat bond has launched with a price guidance range of 6% to 6.5%.The Queen Street VIII Re cat bond launched with price guidance of 6.75% to 7.5%, which was subsequently tightened to 6.5% to 7% and settled at 6.5%. So Munich Re’s latest cat bond is already pitching itself as priced more cheaply from launch and it will be interesting to see where this deal settles to compare price declines on cat bond issuance since last June.For comparison, the mid-point of launch price guidance of Queen Street IX Re is over 12% lower than the mid-point of launch guidance of Queen Street VIII Re and 4% lower than the earlier deal settled at.Update 1:We understand that this cat bond is targeting between $75m and $100m of cover for Munich Re.Pricing has declined to a 5.5% to 6% range.Munich Re’s Queen Street VIII Re cat bond, which has an almost identical risk profile priced in June at 6.5%. So the reinsurers latest cat bond could price another 15% lower than that, if it settles at the bottom of this reduced range at 5.5%.Update 2:Munich Re fixed this cat bond at $100m in size thanks to strong investor demand.The pricing settled at the bottom of the already reduced range, at 5.5%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The 2014 Skyline Re cat bond is not just larger in size than the 2013 issuance, it is also Cincinnati’s first multi-year deal, providing it with three years of cover compared to the 1 year Skyline 2013.So, the Skyline Re 2014-1 cat bond provides Cincinnati Insurance with a three-year source of fully-collateralized reinsurance protection for certain of its earthquake and severe convective storm (thunderstorm, tornado and hail) risks.The cat bond has been cleverly structured to provide Cincinnati Insurance with per-occurrence protection for its earthquake risks and annual aggregate protection for its severe thunderstorm risks. Skyline Re 2014-1 uses an indemnity trigger, as did the insurer’s 2013 cat bond deal.The coverage provided by this cat bond is broader than in the Skyline Re 2013 deal. Earthquake coverage is for a larger territorial area, the 2013 deal covered only the New Madrid quake zone, although the 2014 deal does not cover California. The severe convective storm coverage is regional, as was the Skyline 2013 deal, but it provides cover for a larger area in the 2014 issuance.Steve Johnston, President and CEO of Cincinnati Financial, commented on the coverage provided by Skyline Re 2014; “The coverage applies to severe convective storm losses in selected areas as well as supplemental coverage in the event of an earthquake.”Coverage has been expanded in the 2014 Skyline Re catastrophe bond in a number of ways. The earthquake coverage has been expanded by adding a number of additional states to the deal, so providing earthquake cover for more than just the New Madrid quake zone, which is where the 2013 cat bond was focused.Johnston explained; “In addition to the coverage provided last year related to the New Madrid fault line, it includes several states in the Pacific Northwest.”The coverage for severe convective storms (so thunderstorm, tornado and wind from convective storms as well as hail) was also expanded geographically. The 2013 Skyline Re cat bond had a county focused coverage approach, where as the 2014 deal expands to offer protection across full states.Johnston elaborated; “For both coverages, convective storm and earthquake, the geography related to the coverage was expanded for 2014. The program now generally covers entire states where we have significant amounts of insured property risks instead of just selected counties.”Finally, Johnston gave some detail on the indemnity trigger, a fact not revealed previously about the Skyline Re 2014 cat bond. As we wrote in our article announcing the Skyline Re 2014 cat bond a few weeks ago, the indemnity trigger provides cover on a per-occurrence basis for earthquake risks and annual aggregate for severe thunderstorm.Johnston revealed on the call that the indemnity trigger sits at $160m, with each event having a $5m deductible.Johnston said; “The storm aggregate coverage provides loss recovery once losses for all events in aggregate exceed $160 million after a $5 million deductible per event.”The transaction was launched with initial price guidance of 15% to 16%. This was revised as investor demand for the transaction built up and was reduced to 14% to 15%. Final pricing for the notes was a coupon of 14%, right at the bottom end of the reduced range. That’s effectively a 10% decline in transaction pricing from the middle of the launch guidance range.The risk modelling for this transaction was undertaken by the investors. The investors are provided with a considerable amount of information, these transaction are not really light on documentation and supporting materials despite them often being referred to as cat bond lites, to allow them to do this.JLT Capital Markets acted as both structuring agent and bookrunner for this transaction.The Skyline Re 2014-1 cat bond transaction officially closed on the 23rd January.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

A Class A tranche of notes with a preliminary size of $140m and a Class B tranche sized at $60m are both being offered to ILS investors.Through the issuance of Vitality Re V Limited Aetna is seeking a fully-collateralized source of reinsurance protection for its health insurance portfolio. The risk period is said to be for four years, from the beginning of 2014 to the end of 2018.The reinsurance protection provided by Vitality Re V will cover Aetna against unusual or unexpected rises in its medical benefit claims ratio, providing indemnity protection for claims above a predefined ratio attachment point. The protection provided by Vitality Re V will be on an annual aggregate basis, Artemis understand.The protection is provided through Aetna’s captive reinsurance vehicle Health Re Inc., which enters into excess-of-loss agreements with Vitality re V Ltd., as the ceding reinsurer for the transaction and the protection ultimately reinsures the health insurance portfolio of its Aetna Life Insurance Company (ALIC) subsidiary. ALIC enters into a quota-share agreement with Health Re. The notes will cover the claims payments related to the covered insurance business above a pre-defined medical benefit ratio for each tranche of notes.Under the terms of the quota share reinsurance agreement ALIC will cede on a quota-share basis annually $1 billion of covered business premium to Health Re. ALIC will retain 10% of all medical benefit claims obligations. Health Re then enters into the excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts with Vitality Re V Ltd. which is collateralized through the sale of the notes over the five-year term.The covered business is the commercial insured accident and health business (PPO, point of service, and indemnity lines) directly written by ALIC and reported in its annual statutory statements as “Accident and Health-Group,” except for a number of specified exclusions.The $140m Class A tranche of notes has a medical benefit ratio attachment point of 102% and a medical benefit ratio exhaustion point of 116%. These equate to an attachment point of $1.02 billion and an exhaustion point of $1.16 billion. This gives the notes an attachment probability of just 5bps and an expected loss of just 1bps.The Class B tranche of $60m notes has a medical benefit ratio attachment point of 96% and a medical benefit ratio exhaustion point of 102%. These equate to an attachment point of $960m and an exhaustion point of $1.02 billion. This gives the notes an attachment probability of 53bps and an expected loss of 21bps.The Class B tranche is the riskier of the two, reflected in the price guidance which is detailed below. The transaction as a whole will provide Aetna with protection from an attachment of $960m up to an exhaustion of $1.16 billion, so as this is a $200m layer it’s likely that the deal will not upsize unless Aetna chooses to expand the protection further.Price guidance for the expected coupon to be paid to investors from each tranche of notes is a range of 2% to 2.75% for the Class A notes and 2.75% to 3.5% for the Class B tranche.As well as covering fluctuations in the medical benefit ratio the Vitality Re ILS deals also provide Aetna with tail risk cover for severe pandemics. In fact pandemic risk makes up a large proportion of the expected loss on this transaction, as much as 88.58% of the expected loss for the Class B notes and 99.55% for the Class A notes.Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said that it has assigned its preliminary ratings of ‘BBB+(sf)’ and ‘BB+(sf)’ to the Class A and Class B notes, respectively. These ratings are currently based on the underlying medical benefit ratio risk factor, however S&P noted that if it lowered the rating on ALIC to less than the MBR risk factor, it would lower the rating on the notes accordingly.S&P noted in its pre sale report that the highest that the medical benefit ratio has been for the covered business since 2006 is 88.5% in 2009. This remains well below the attachment point of these, or any of the previous, Vitality Re tranches of notes.From 1996 through the first nine months of 2013, for a broader block of business and other related lines of health insurance policies, the medical benefit ratios (MBR) ranged from 76.0% in 2003 to 89.3% in 2001; and 79.5% for the first nine months of 2013.Vitality Re I and Vitality Re II both matured on the 7th January 2014 which means that this transaction will replace at least some of the cover from those two deals for Aetna.Update:The Class A tranche saw pricing settle right down at 1.75%, a decline of around 26% from the mid-point of the launch range.The Class B tranche, which is a little riskier in terms of attachment probability, settled down at 2.5%, a decline of 20% from the mid-point of the launch price guidance.These two tranches in the Vitality Re V transaction sit directly alongside the two from Vitality Re IV, issued a year earlier. The Class A tranche issued in 2013 pays investors 2.75%, so the 2014 deal is a whole percentage point lower (36% lower coupon rate). The Class B tranche from 2013 pays 3.75%, so the 2014 deal is 1.25% lower in terms of coupon paid on that layer, which is around a 33% reduction in coupon cost to the sponsor.This clearly demonstrates the reduction in ILS pricing over the last year and also the low cost-of-capital that ILS capital can bring to sponsors of catastrophe bonds and ILS.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The reinsurance coverage provided will be on an indemnity and per-occurrence basis, Artemis understands.The notes being issued by VenTerra Re will provide broad cover for these perils, according to S&P, as the covered perils for earthquakes includes; related earth shake, fire, sprinkler leakage, volcanic disturbance or eruption, tsunami, and flooding due to dam or levy ruptures, and the coverage for tropical cyclones includes; ensuing damage caused by related windstorm, rainstorm, hailstorm, tornado, flood, and storm surge.The transaction covers a number of QBE Insurance Group subsidiaries, but the transaction is being facilitated through QBE’s captive reinsurer Equator Reinsurances Ltd. Equator Re will act as the agent for the companies covered by the deal for the purposes of sending and receiving notices required under the reinsurance agreements, as well as for remitting or receiving any amounts due to or from VenTerra Re.That means that Equator Re will make premium payments due to VenTerra Re and will funnel the premiums from each covered subsidiary. Equator Re will be responsible for paying funds from any subsidiary that does not make a payment as well.S&P notes that the trigger, which is indemnity based, is more narrowly defined than many recent cat bonds it has assessed. In the case of VenTerra Re, this means that the trigger cannot be interpreted to aggregate earthquakes occurring more than a week apart.In fact the trigger also include a parametric element in it as only earthquake events of a certain intensity or greater can qualify as a covered event for ground shake under the terms of the deal.S&P explains;“An earthquake is reported by the USGS and identified in the U.S. earthquake event report available 30 calendar days after its occurrence time if it caused ground shaking in the covered area with instrumental intensity of VI or greater. An earthquake in Australia is reported by the USGS–or if not the USGS, Geoscience Australia–and identified in the Australian earthquake event report available 30 calendar days after the occurrence if it caused ground shaking in the covered area with instrumental intensity of VI or greater.To clarify, “ground shaking in the covered area” means that, if a quake happens and does not cause shaking inside the covered area but a tsunami were to hit the covered area, this would be a covered event. “Instrumental intensity of VI or greater,” on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MMI), means “felt by all, many frightened. Some heavy furniture moved; a few instances of fallen plaster. Damage slight.” This is the first level on the scale where damage starts to occur.If any earthquake directly or indirectly causes losses over a period of greater than seven calendar days, the ceding insurer may divide such earthquake into two or more loss occurrences provided that no two seven calendar-day periods may overlap.An Australian cyclone is a storm or storm system that is, or at any time was, named by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) or its successor to be a tropical cyclone at any time.”The primary risk for the VenTerra Re cat bond is U.S. earthquake, the Australian perils make up just 27% of the modelled risk. The exposures in Australia are fairly widespread which means that any missing data should not have a major bearing on the deal, according to S&P. Most of the exposure in the VenTerra Re cat bond is to personal lines and multifamily dwellings.The covered area is all 50 states and the District of Columbia for U.S. earthquake risk; for Australian earthquakes and cyclones, the covered area is the entire Commonwealth of Australia.Based on historical loss analysis undertaken by RMS only the 1906 San Francisco earthquake would have triggered the cat bond. The estimated loss is 59% of the layer from that event. Based on the definition of U.S. earthquakes used in the deal, the 1811-1812 New Madrid quakes would not have been a triggering event. The two most significant events in Australia were the 1954 Adelaide earthquake and 1918 Mackay cyclone. The modeled losses from these events were A$861 million and A$662 million, respectively.S&P raise a number of other interesting points about the VenTerra Re Ltd. catastrophe bond:The deal covers volcanic eruptions triggered by earthquakes, but the risk modeller RMS does not model losses for volcanic eruption. Also increased seismic activity can help scientists predict volcanic eruptions and where they occur they have the potential to create large insured losses. S&P notes that; “A large volcanic eruption is likely to result in complicated coverage questions in ascertaining whether the earth movement caused the eruption and could lead to coverage by the noteholders.”Tsunami caused by earthquake is also covered, again these are not a modelled peril and they could be caused by an earthquake which does not create enough ground shake to trigger the cat bond, but the tsunami itself could cause it to trigger.Interestingly, S&P says that large portions of the covered business information is not as detailed as in other cat bond transactions. Large portions of the data are coded as “unknown” or “other”, which S&P says is in line with industry practice in Australia.Modelling for Australian perils is generally not as complete as for U.S., so for this cat bond the Australian earthquake and tropical cyclone models do not include factors such as demand surge, fire following or sprinkler leakage, which are modelled for the U.S. earthquake risk. However, S&P noted that these should generally be smaller losses in Australia than in the U.S., as Australia is not as prone to large catastrophes and is less densely populated than the U.S.The single tranche of notes have an attachment point of USD$1.5 billion for U.S. earthquake risks and AUD$4.25 billion for Australian cyclone and earthquake risks. The exhaustion points are USD$1.75 billion for U.S. earthquakes and AUD$4.5 billion for the Australian perils.The attachment probability for the notes is 1.52%, the expected loss is 1.35% and the exhaustion probability is 1.21%. The notes are said to be being offered with price guidance of 3.75% to 4.5%.Update 1: The single tranche of notes offerd by VenTerra Re Ltd. grew by 25% to finally offer $250m of notes to investors and reinsurance protection to QBE.At the same time the pricing dropped on the transaction, from the original range of 3.75% to 4.5%, the pricing finally settled at 3.75%, approximately 10% down from the mid-point of the guidance range.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2013-1)","Argo Group","Swiss Re Capital Markets are structuring agent and bookrunner","AIR Worldwide","U.S tropical cyclones, U.S earthquake, U.S. severe thunderstorm","$172m","Indemnity & industry loss","NR","Dec 2013","For its third catastrophe bond deal Argo Group has established a new Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurer, Loma Reinsurance (Bermuda) Ltd. This is Argo’s first transaction for two years, since December 2011.In this first Series 2013-1 issuance through Loma Reinsurance (Bermuda) Ltd. Argo is seeking a four-year source of reinsurance and retrocessional protection from capital market investors against tropical cyclones, U.S. earthquakes and U.S. severe thunderstorms on an annual aggregate basis, we understand. The preliminary size of the deal is said to be at least $100m.We’re told that the transaction uses a novel trigger, which we believe to be the first of its kind in a 144A cat bond issuance, a combined indemnity and industry loss trigger. We’re told that the trigger will be derived from the sum of ultimate net loss to Argo’s U.S. business and Syndicate 1200 and insurance industry losses, as reported by Property Claim Services (PCS), weighted by region and the amount of industry losses attributable to Argo Re.That’s an interesting trigger construction, which perhaps seeks to reduce basis risk against the industry loss measure but at the same time ensure that coverage is sufficiently broad on an industry loss basis to cover all eventual scenarios where by Argo Re would become responsible for paying its insureds claims. It also allows Argo to combine reinsurance for its insurance businesses and retro for Argo Re within a single transaction.Argo will retain a 10% share of losses within each risk period, we understand and a franchise deductible of $15m is applied. The ultimate beneficiaries of this cat bond will be Argo Group subsidiaries Argonaut Insurance, Argo Re and Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200.Three classes of notes are being issued, we understand, a Class A tranche with an attachment point of $425m and exhaustion at $475m, Class B with an attachment point of $325m and exhaustion at $425m and Class C with an attachment point of $225m and exhaustion at $325m. That suggests that this deal could grow to $250m across the three tranches if investor demand allows.The Class A notes have an attachment probability of 4.13%, an expected loss of 3.77%, an exhaustion probability of 3.43% and are being offered with price guidance of 10.5% to 11.5%.The Class B notes have an attachment probability of 6.04%, an expected loss of 5.02%, an exhaustion probability of 4.13% and are being offered with price guidance of 12.75% to 13.75%.Finally, the Class C notes have an attachment probability of 10.32%, an expected loss of 7.95%, an exhaustion probability of 6.04% and are being offered with price guidance of 17.5% (no guidance range offered with this tranche we are told).The transaction features a variable reset mechanism, allowing Argo more flexibility should it opt to adjust the coverage provided by this layer during the term of the cat bond deal.Update 1: This cat bond transaction has grown in size by 65% while marketing, from a target issuance size of $100m when the deal launched to now offer $165m of notes.The three tranches of notes being offered by Loma Re (Bermuda) have all seen pricing decline to below the lower end of the originally marketed ranges. The individual tranches of notes were not sized when the deal launched.The Class A tranche is currently $25m in size. It launched with price guidance of 10.5% to 11.5%, but this has declined to a range of 9.75% to 10.5%.The Class B tranche is $75m in size. This tranche launched with price guidance of 12.75% to 13.75%, but this range has dropped to 12% to 12.75%.The Class C tranche of notes is $65m in size. This tranche launched with price guidance of 17.5% but is now being offered with guidance of 17% to 17.5%.Update 2: The latest Loma Re cat bond has grown again, but only slightly by $7m, increasing to $172m in size. At the same time, the three tranches of notes being offered by Loma Re (Bermuda) have all seen pricing settle at the bottom of the reduced guidance ranges.The Class A tranche launched with price guidance of 10.5% to 11.5%, which was reduced to a range of 9.75% to 10.5%. Pricing has now settled at 9.75%, a reduction of over 11% from the mid-point of the launch range.The Class B tranche launched with price guidance of 12.75% to 13.75%, which was lowered to 12% to 12.75%. Pricing settled at 12%, a reduction of over 9% from the launch price guidance mid-point.The Class C tranche launched with price guidance of 17.5%, which was subsequently reduced to guidance of 17% to 17.5%. Pricing settled at 17%, a small reduction of about 3% from the launch guidance.Update, 24th October 2017:Following hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria the Loma Re 2013-1 catastrophe bond is likely to be triggered and at least one class of notes face a loss.Sources said that based on a published loss report featuring Argo’s qualifying indemnity losses, the likelihood is that the riskiest $65 million Class C tranche of notes are a total loss and there is a chance that the $75 million Class B tranche, which sits above, could also begin to be eaten into.Argo has reported a qualifying indemnity loss of $267.7 million, sources said, which is enough to eat into the Class C notes that attach at $240 million.Based on initial calculations, the industry loss component is likely to contribute another $75.8 million, based on preliminary estimates.Adding together the indemnity and industry loss components of the loss estimates gives a total of $343.5 million, which would exhaust the $65 million of Class C notes and eat $3.5 million into the $75 million Class B layer as well.Note: These loss estimates are based on preliminary information from Artemis’ sources and our own calculations using initial estimates, therefore subject to change.Update, 10th January 2018:Argo Group elected to extend the maturity of the most at-risk $65 million of Class C notes, to allow for loss development to complete.At the same time the re/insurer allowed the Class A and B tranches of notes to mature and noteholders received their full principal back, as it became clear that these two tranches of notes would not face any loss.The $65 million Class C tranche of notes have been extened to April 8th 2018 to allow for further loss development and estimates to come in. Sources suggest these notes holders are likely to lose the majority of their principal and say the chances of noteholders receiving much back is slim.Update, 5th April 2018:The $65 million Class C tranche has had its maturity extended again to July 8th 2018, to allow for further loss development. The secondary prices for the tranche are now sitting for bids of around 55 to 60, suggesting at worst a 45% loss of principal based on the latest loss estimates.Update – Jan 4th 2019:The remaining $65 million of notes from Loma Re’s 2013-1 Class C tranche have been extended again, to allow for continue loss development, with maturity now set for April 8th 2019.Update – Sep 13th 2019:Argo has elected to extend the maturity date of the Loma Re 2013-1 Class C notes further to October 8th 2019, in the hope of claiming on the reinsurance protection they provide once loss development has completed. The notes are marked down for bids of roughly 40 cents on the dollar.Update – Mar 5th, 2020:The $65 million of outstanding Class C notes have had their maturity extended further again to April 8th 2020, as loss development continues.The notes are now marked down in the secondary market for bids of around 20, suggesting a roughly 80% loss of principal is expected by investors.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

AIG Global Capital Markets Securities is placement agent","RMS","U.S., Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico named storms. U.S., Canada earthquake","$400m","Indemnity","NR","Dec 2013","With Tradewynd Re 2013-2 AIG is seeking at least $100m of protection against a diverse portfolio of risks. The transaction is structured into four tranches of notes, two of which have a one-year term the other two providing cover for three-years. In this way AIG is seeking a mix of single and multi-year, fully-collateralized reinsurance protection. All four tranches provide indemnity protection on a per-occurrence basis, we understand.According to sources the cover provided by Tradewynd Re 2013-2 will be for very similar types of business as the 2013-1 issuance. Due to the unmodelled nature of some of the risks, AIG is said to be providing additional information to enable investors to better model and assess the risks within the cat bond, as well as an analysis of exposure information. Data has also been provided to the three main risk modelling firms, RMS, AIR and EQECAT, to enable them to also analyse the risks and provide advice to clients.The inclusion of unmodelled, or less well modelled, risks within a catastrophe bond demands a greater level of data provision. Investors need to be able to get comfortable with the risks they are taking on and the only way to do that is to have a clear picture of the risks and exposure bundled within the deal, enabling them to analyse and model the transaction more fully.The transaction is targeting a size of at least $100m through the issuance of four tranches of notes. All four tranches will provide cover for named storms (so tropical, subtropical and hurricanes) in the U.S., Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, as well as earthquake risks in the U.S. and Canada. All four tranches will use an indemnity trigger and provide per-occurrence protection.A Class 1-A tranche of notes will provide one-year protection, from January to the end of December 2014. This tranche has an attachment probability of 1.3%, an expected loss of 1.16% and an exhaustion probability of 1.02%. They attach at $5 billion of losses and provide a percentage of cover up to an exhaustion point of $5.5 billion we’re told. These notes are being offered with a coupon guidance range of 6% to 6.75% we understand.A Class 1-B tranche is also one-year in duration, covering AIG for 2014. These are a little riskier, with an attachment probability of 1.67%, an expected loss of 1.47% and an exhaustion probability of 1.3%. They attach at $4.5 billion of losses and cover up to an exhaustion point of $5 billion. According to sources these notes are being offered with a coupon guidance range of 6.75% to 7.5%.A Class 3-A tranche provide three-year cover, from January 2014 to the end of December 2016. They cover the same layer of risk as the Class 1-A, attaching at $5 billion of losses to AIG and exhausting at $5.5 billion. The attachment probability is 1.3%, expected loss is 1.16% and exhaustion probability is 1.02%. These notes are being offered with a price guide range of 6.25% to 7%.The final Class 3-B tranche is also a three-year cover, from Jan 2014 to end of Dec 2016. These cover the same layer of risk as the Class 1-B tranche, losses from at $4.5 billion up to $5 billion, so have an attachment probability of 1.67%, an expected loss of 1.47% and an exhaustion probability of 1.3%. The price guidance for these notes is 7% to 7.75%.The two three-year tranches both feature a variable reset mechanism, we’re told, a popular feature allowing the sponsor to elect to increase the probability of attachment and expected loss, within defined bounds, as well as increasing the interest spread in line with the changes. We’re unsure what the boundaries are for the allowed changes but understand the notes could only become riskier, not less risky if a variable reset is elected by AIG.We understand that the covered book of business is similar to Tradewynd Re 2013-1, so includes both personal lines consumer policies as well as commercial insurance lines of business.The personal lines book includes lines such as residential coverage, high net worth personal lines, auto physical damage, yacht and fine art and collections and excess and surplus business. The commercial book covers diverse risks from commercial property, to energy risks, engineering risks, marine, aerospace and some of AIG’s program business. Similarly to Tradewynd 2013-1, this cat bond covers named storms in the Gulf of Mexico, plus energy risks, which suggests coverage for offshore energy platforms and associated covered assets.Update 1: One of the four tranches of notes has been withdrawn from the issuance and the other three now have preliminary sizes which in total add up to $180m.The riskier of the 1-year tranches of notes, Class 1-B, has been withdrawn from the offering.The Class 1-A tranche, which provides 1-year protection, from January to the end of December 2014 has a preliminary size of $30m we understand. These notes launched with a coupon guidance range of 6% to 6.75% , but that range has now tightened to 6% to 6.25%.The Class 3-A tranche, which provides 3-year cover, from January 2014 to the end of December 2016 has a preliminary size of $75m. These cover the same layer of risk as the Class 1-A notes. This tranche was launched with a price guide range of 6.25% to 7% which has now tightened to 6.25% to 6.5%.Finally, the Class 3-B tranche, also a three-year cover, from Jan 2014 to end of Dec 2016, has a preliminary size of $75m. This tranche would have provided cover for the same layer as the withdrawn Class 1-B notes. The price guidance for these notes when the deal launched was 7% to 7.75%, but this tranche has also see pricing tighten to 7% to 7.25%.Update 2: The Tradewynd Re 2013-2 cat bond has now grown in size again to offer $400m of notes from the remaining three tranches.At the same time the pricing has been set to the top end of the narrowed range.The tranches now look as follows:The Class 1-A tranche has more than tripled from to $100m we understand. The price guidance was set at 6.25%.The Class 3-A tranche has more than doubled to $160m in size. The price guidance has now been set at 6.5%.Finally, the Class 3-B tranche has almost doubled to $140m. The price guidance has been set at 7.25%.Update 3: Pricing moved again on this transaction, with two tranches dropping to the bottom of initial pricing guidance.Latest:Class 1-A – still $100m in size and pricing unchanged at 6.25%.Class 3-A – still $160m in size. But price guidance reduced to the lower end of the originally marketed range, at 6.25%.Class 3-B – still $140m. Price guidance reduced down to the lower end of the original range at 7%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Class 1 notes unrated","Dec 2013","This is USAA’s twenty-first catastrophe bond under the Residential Re banner.This latest Residential Re cat bond sees USAA seeking a multi-peril source of fully-collateralized reinsurance protection, using an indemnity trigger and on a per-occurrence basis over a four-year period, via the issuance and sale to investors of two tranches of Series 2013-2 notes through Cayman Islands based Residential Reinsurance 2013 Limited.The first tranche of notes, which we understand to be Class 1, will cover U.S. tropical storms but excluding the state of Florida, U.S. earthquakes, severe thunderstorms, winter storms and wildfires in California. This tranche is being marketed with a preliminary size of $50m.The second tranche, which we’re told is Class 4, covers U.S. tropical storms including the state of Florida, U.S. earthquakes, severe thunderstorms, winter storms and wildfires in California. This tranche has a preliminary size of $70m, we understand.Now the interesting aspect of the deal, the levels of risk and reward in the two classes of notes offered.Class 1 is the riskier of the two and we’re told has a probability of attachment of 21.38%, an expected loss of 13.06% and is being marketed with a coupon guidance range of 21% to 22%. We’re struggling to think of a cat bond tranche in our Deal Directory with a higher attachment probability and coupon than that.The Class 4 tranche is much less risky, with an attachment probability of 2.26%, an expected loss of 1.61% and offering a coupon in the range of 5.75% to 6.5%. This is much more typical of an average yielding cat bond tranche.We understand that the Class 1 notes attach at $400m of losses to USAA and will pay losses on a sliding scale, depending on the size the tranche actually completes at, up to an exhaustion point of $800m. Class 4 notes meanwhile attach at $2.076 billion of losses and again cover losses on a pro-rata basis up to the exhaustion point of $2.993 billion.The Residential Re 2013-2 cat bond covers personal-lines losses only, including from homeowners, condominiums, rental and dwelling insurance policies. The coverage will benefit USAA itself, as well as affiliates including; USAA Casualty Insurance Co., USAA Texas Lloyd’s Co., USAA General Indemnity Co., Garrison Property and Casualty Insurance Co.USAA will itself retain at least a 10% share of the losses in the attachment layer of the Class 4 notes, according to S&P’s pre-sale report. It’s likely that the same share will be retained in the Class 1 layer as well, which is typical of cat bond deals.The cat bond will provide USAA and affiliates with protection over a four-year term, but across five risk-periods. The reason for this is that the first risk period is slated to begin in December 2013 but the annual resets are to occur on June 1st, ready for the hurricane season, meaning that there are risk periods of roughly six months and three of a year.The transaction covers:Losses from hurricanes in; Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.Losses from earthquakes in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. However, it will not cover losses arising out of property damage caused by fire following in Hawaii or Alaska.Losses from severe thunderstorms and winter storms in the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia.Losses from wildfire in California.Based on risk analysis from AIR Worldwide, no historic hurricane or earthquake generated net losses that would have resulted in losses for note holders for the Class 4 notes. The next three historical events that generated the highest modeled losses for the Class 4 tranche were the 1906 San Francisco earthquake ($1.972 billion), the 1812 New Madrid earthquake ($1.828 billion), and the NoName4 Hurricane that made landfall in 1938 in New York ($1.625 billion).Given the low attachment point of the unrated Class 1 tranche of notes Artemis understands that historical modelling showed that a number of events would have caused a loss to noteholders. For example, Artemis is told that the NoName4 Hurricane that made landfall in 1938 in New York would have caused a 100% loss of principal to the Class 1 notes, as would hurricane Hazel which struck South Carolina in 1954 and hurricane Katrina which struck New Orleans in 2005. A number of other historical hurricane events would have caused some loss of principal to these notes.Three historical earthquake events would have caused a 100% loss of principal to the Class 1 notes, Artemis understands. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake, 1812 New Madrid quake and the 1886 Charleston earthquake. No other modelled historical earthquake events would have breached the trigger.According to S&P, at the current $70m size the Class 4 notes would provide cover for 7.63% of losses between the attachment point of $2.076 billion and the exhaustion point of $2.993 billion. That percentage will change if the tranche of notes increases in size.The $50m of Class 4 notes, which attach at $400m of losses to USAA will cover 12.5% of losses (at the current tranche size, up to the exhaustion point of $800m. Again that percentage could change depending on the investor appetite for the riskier tranche of notes.Residential Reinsurance 2013 Ltd. is a Cayman Islands domiciled special purpose vehicle and is being administered by Kane (Cayman) Ltd.The proceeds from the sale of the notes will be deposited in a trust account and invested in U.S. Treasury money market funds.Update:The multi-peril cat bond transaction as a whole has increased in size by 25%, from $120m to a currently marketed size of $150m. The deal has not yet closed to investor subscriptions, Artemis understands, so there is a chance that it could grow a little further.Interestingly, the tranche which has upsized is the riskier Class 1 tranche, which has a probability of attachment of 21.38%, an expected loss of 13.06% and was marketed with pricing guidance of 21% to 22%. This Class 1 tranche is now $80m in size, up by 60% from the $50m it was marketed at, showing that investors are happy to take this, perhaps most risky cat bond tranche issued, layer of catastrophe risk right at the bottom of USAA’s reinsurance tower.The Class 1 tranche price guidance has also reduced, down to 20% to 21%, showing that investors are also willing to price this riskier layer at a level which likely makes it extremely attractive to USAA.Meanwhile, the Class 4 tranche of notes, which is less risky with an attachment probability of 2.26%, an expected loss of 1.61% and launching with a pricing range of 5.75% to 6.5%, has remained the same size at $70m. Pricing expectation has however dropped to 5.25% to 5.75%, again showing ILS investors demand for new risk.Update 2:Both of the tranches issued saw their price guidance lowered as the deal came to market. In the end both tranches were priced at the lowest end of the already reduced range, showing continued strong appetite for cat bond risk, even at the riskier attachment level.The Class 1 tranche was marketed with pricing guidance of 21% to 22%, which was subsequently lowered to 20% to 21%. Final pricing for this risky tranche was at 20%, which is almost a 7% drop in pricing from the mid-point of the originally marketed range.The Class 4 tranche of notes launched with a pricing range of 5.75% to 6.5%, which subsequently was lowered to 5.25% to 5.75%. This tranche priced at the lowest end again, at 5.25%, a 14% decline in pricing from the originally marketed mid-point.Update, November 29th 2017:We understand that USAA has elected to repay half of the Class 1 notes $80 million of principal at maturity, but to extend the remaining $40 million as its loss estimates develop for the recent California wildfires.By extending maturity on half of the tranche, so $40 million of principal, USAA is making sure there is some collateral remaining on account to pay for any losses should its estimate for the impact of the California wildfires surpass the notes attachment point (which had been $400m at launch of the cat bond tranche).The latest loss estimate from USAA suggested that its California wildfire losses would be between $387 million and $581 million, so there is a reasonable chance that the final loss determination could have caused some loss of principal for these notes, eating into the reinsurance coverage they provide with the Class 1 notes being most at risk.Update, February 28th 2018:The maturity date for the remaining $40 million of principal from the Class 1 notes has been extended again to June 6th 2018, to allow for loss development from the California wildfires to continue.Update, August 29th 2018:Half of the $40 million of remaining Class 1notes have been allowed to mature and are to be repaid to investors, leaving another $20 million remaining which have now had their maturity extended again to December 6th 2018.Update Dec 5th, 2018:The remaining $20 million of notes from this tranche have now been extended further to March 6th 2019, to allow for further development of losses. These notes are priced for a roughly 65% loss of principal in the secondary market.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The Galileo Re cat bond will cover losses from most of Catlin’s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries as well as its Lloyd’s syndicates.Being a cat bond providing annual aggregate cover, this deal will accumulate losses throughout each annual risk period, with reported industry losses being converted to an event index value which will accumulate during the year.The attachment point is an index value of $480m and the exhaustion point is an index level of $800m, while a $40m event deductible applies.The reporting agencies for each of the perils are PCS for U.S. named storms and U.S. earthquakes and PERILS for European windstorms. AIR Worldwide is the risk modelling firm for this cat bond.The $175m of notes being marketed have an annualised attachment probability of 3.6%, an annualised exhaustion probability of 1.31% and an annualised expected loss of 2.22%.The notes are being offered to investors with coupon guidance of 7.75% to 8.5%.Update: The Galileo Re catastrophe bond was increased in size while marketing by 43% to $250m in size.At the same time investor demand helped to drive down the price guidance to below the original range at 7.4% to 7.75% before it closed.Update 2: Galileo Re grew in size again before final pricing, hitting $300m in size.At the same time the pricing declined to the bottom of the reduced range to come in at 7.4%.Over the course of the deal that’s an increase in size of approximately 71% and a reduction in pricing of -9% from the mid-point of the originally marketed range.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

This first deal under Calypso Capital II will see AXA looking to secure a multi-year source of fully-collateralized European windstorm coverage from the capital markets for its AXA Global P&C subsidiary.The transaction has a preliminary size of €200m, we understand, with two tranches of notes being marketed to capital markets investors. Both tranches of notes will be exposed to European windstorms on an industry loss basis, with PERILS AG acting as a reporting agency providing a CRESTA zone and line of business weighted industry loss index. Protection from both of the tranches is on a per-occurrence basis and the deal covers both first and subsequent qualifying European windstorm events.A €100m Class A tranche of notes has an attachment probability of 1.45%, an exhaustion probability of 0.61% and an expected loss of 0.96%. The attachment point is at €2.11 billion on the PERILS weighted industry loss index up to an exhaustion point of $3 billion.A €100m Class B tranche of notes is a little riskier, with an attachment probability of 2.11%, an exhaustion probability of 0.62% and an expected loss of 1.18%. The attachment point for these notes is at €1.78 billion on the PERILS weighted industry loss index up to an exhaustion point of $3 billion.The tranches of notes have differing risk periods we understand. The Class A notes will run for three years from the 1st January 2014 up to the end of 2016, but the Class B notes have a longer term of four years, running to the end of 2017.Also of interest is the fact that again AXA has chosen to market its cat bond in advance of the risk period beginning.We understand that a token interest coupon will be paid to investors up until the risk period proper begins in January. This is a clever way to get a cat bond out to an investor audience which right now does not have a lot of transactions to review, rather than aiming to market it at the end of the year when the pipeline will be much busier.Both tranches of notes have variable reset features. The Class A notes can be reset within pre-defined limits (of attachment and expected loss) if the sponsor elects to, with the interest spread being adjusted as well so investors are compensated. The Class B notes have a mandatory variable reset clause, meaning that they must be adjusted and will become more risky for the second annual risk period. This gives the sponsor the guarantee of where that protection will sit within its reinsurance program a year down the line from issuance and could help it save money on that layer should reinsurance prices rise.Following a reset, the one-year probability of attachment can increase to as high as 2.05% for the Class A notes and 3.20% for the Class B notes.In its ratings review Standard & Poor’s explains the loss calcualtion process for the cat bond:If a European windstorm occurs during the risk period and the calculation agent confirms that it resulted in an industry loss index equal to or above €2.11 billion for the class A notes and €1.78 billion for the class B notes, it is considered a covered event. For each covered event, the calculation agent will calculate the event index value using the following method: 1) For a Europe windstorm event, obtain the estimated industry insured losses by line of business for each CRESTA zone in the covered area from the reporting agency. 2) For each class of notes, apply the relevant payout factors and currency conversion factors, as applicable, to the reporting agency’s estimated insured losses by line of business for each CRESTA Zone in the covered area. 3) Determine the Europe windstorm index value for each class of notes by summing the resulting values from step 2 in each CRESTA zone or line of business in the covered area of the respective class. 4) For each class of notes, determine the Europe windstorm event percentage using the following formula: (Europe Windstorm Index Value – Attachment Level)/(Exhaustion Level – Attachment Level). The Europe windstorm event percentage is floored at 0% and capped at 100%. 5) Multiply (A) the aggregate event percentage (the smaller of (i) the sum of the Europe windstorm event percentages for all Europe windstorm events and (ii) 100%) of such class at a payment date minus the aggregate event percentage of such class as of the immediately prior payment date by (B) the original principal amount of such class.We understand that the countries covered under this cat bond will be Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and UK. These are the most European windstorm exposed nations for AXA, with the highest insured exposures. For AXA itself France will make up the largest exposure in this cat bond followed by the UK and then Germany.S&P noted in their review of the transaction that were the Class B notes to be reset to their highest probability of attachment then the December 1999 European windstorm Lothar event could have triggered them.We understand that the Class A notes are being marketed to investors with price guidance of 2.6% to 3.1%, while the Class B notes have pricing guidance of 2.9% to 3.4%.Update: Strong investor demand has helped AXA upsize this cat bond by 75% and the transaction is now offering €350m (approximately $476m) of notes to investors.The deal has gone from two tranches of €100m, to a Class A tranche of €185m and a Class B tranche of €165m.Price guidance has dropped to the bottom of the marketed range for both of the tranches, we understand. The Class A tranche has seen its guidance tighten from a range of 2.6% to 3.1% to now offer notes at 2.6%. The Class B notes were marketed at 2.9% to 3.4% and now look set to price offering investors a return of 2.9%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

SCOR has however secured mortality protection via retrocessional reinsurance and also a mortality swap in the past.The transaction will seek to provide sponsor SCOR Global Life SE with a multi-year source of extreme mortality protection, which will provide it with a fully-collateralized, capital markets backed source of protection against mortality events. The types of events which could cause excess mortality on such a scale to threaten a mortality cat bond like this would likely be pandemics, such as influenza outbreaks, earthquakes causing large loss of life, pandemics, disease outbreaks, terrorist events, nuclear accidents or an outbreak of war.The Atlas IX Capital mortality bond is offering two tranches of notes to investors and hopes to raise at least $125m of retrocessional reinsurance protection for SCOR. The transaction will provide SCOR with extreme mortality protection over roughly a 5 year period, with a risk period that runs from the start of 2013 through to the end of 2018.Atlas IX Capital will protect SCOR against extreme mortality events across the U.S. and the District of Colombia. The transaction will use a mortality index trigger based on data from the U.S. CDC (Center for Disease Control). The index will be weighted by both age and gender.A Class A tranche of notes is being marketed with a preliminary size of $75m, with an attachment probability of 0.74%, an expected loss of 0.58% and offering a coupon in the range of 2.5% to 3.25%. This tranche triggers at an index level of 104% we are told.The second, Class B, tranche of notes is marketed at $50m in size, with an attachment probability of 1.16%, an expected loss of 0.92% and offering investors a coupon return in the range of 3.25% to 4%. This tranche triggers at an index level of 102%. The Class B tranche is a little more risky than Class A.To determine if the notes are triggered by an extreme mortality event, an index will be created utilising the CDC data on the mortality event and the calculation agent will establish whether the number of mortalities is above the trigger point or not.Aon Benfield Securities are structuring this transaction for SCOR and also a joint-bookrunner, alongside BNP Paribas and Natixis. RMS are providing risk modelling and calculation services.Risk Management Solutions (RMS) is risk modelling and calculation agent for this Atlas IX Capital mortality bond. RMS used a number of its models when assessing the risk and evaluating the transaction, including the RMS Longevity Model, RMS Infectious Disease Model, RMS U.S. Earthquake Casualty Model, RMS Probabilistic Terrorism Model Version and RMS Statistically Modeled Perils (RMS Residual Risk Model).The deal does cover some remote unmodeled risks, such as the outbreak of an epidemic or the occurrence of a major tsunami. S&P also noted that there is uncertainty in the modelling as it is difficult to compare current mortality rates to historical rates due to medical advances and changes in lifestyle. A significant amount of the risk in this deal originates from the infectious disease model.RMS performed risk analysis by reconstructing historical events to see how they would impact the Atlas IX Capital mortality bond notes. RMS concluded that only a recurrence of the 1918 flu pandemic caused by a virus would result in complete losses of principal on both the Class A and B notes. Conversely, in a bacterial scenario, RMS found that no losses would be reported on Class A while a principal reduction of 99.4% would occur on Class B.Over the last 100 years even events such as the peak of AIDS deaths in 1987 and the Sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks would not have triggered a loss under either of the Atlas IX Capital tranches. S&P believes that the biggest risks to this transaction are man-made catastrophes, such as a nuclear, chemical, or biological war or terrorist attack; a major natural catastrophe; or a substantial pandemic which has very limited vaccine or known treatment.The Atlas IX Capital mortality catastrophe bond issuance includes two tranches of notes and hopes to raise at least $125m of retrocessional reinsurance protection for SCOR. The risk period is from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2018, so six years, and within that period there are five overlapping two-year risk periods during which mortality losses can aggregate towards the trigger points.That’s an unusual way to structure a deal, but it will ensure that a single extreme mortality event from the start of 2014 onwards will always be contained within two of the two-year overlapping risk periods. This will make the chance of the bond being triggered very slightly higher we’d assume, but as a structural feature it improves the protection for the sponsor considerably.Standard & Poor’s provide a diagram of the risk period and further explain this feature (below):S&P explained in the pre-sale report:Within a six-year risk period, there are five different measurement periods for which a loss can occur, as illustrated above. A principal reduction can occur only after the first measurement period has elapsed, that is, after the first two calendar years of a risk period have elapsed. If there is a loss in two adjacent measurement periods, the loss in the later measurement period will only count to the extent that it exceeds the immediately preceding measurement period.Investors who hold the notes will be at risk of an increase in age and gender-weighted mortality rates exceeding those specified percentages of the reference mortality index values across the United States and District of Colombia. So if the mortality experience hits 102% the Class B tranche would be triggered, should it rise to 104% or higher the Class B notes collateral would be exhausted and the Class A noteholders would begin to be affected.The transaction uses a mortality index trigger based on data from the U.S. CDC (Center for Disease Control). To determine if the notes are triggered by an extreme mortality event, the calculation agent will use CDC data on the mortality event to establish whether the number of mortalities is above the trigger point (percentage) or not.Risk Management Solutions (RMS) is risk modelling and calculation agent for this Atlas IX Capital mortality bond. RMS used a number of its models when assessing the risk and evaluating the transaction, including the RMS Longevity Model, RMS Infectious Disease Model, RMS U.S. Earthquake Casualty Model, RMS Probabilistic Terrorism Model Version and RMS Statistically Modeled Perils (RMS Residual Risk Model).In its assessment of the transaction Standard & Poor’s said that the underlying mortality risk exposure shows strong diversification in terms of age and gender, an important fact in the deals rating. S&P also noted that response to pandemic risk events has improved since it first rated a mortality bond in 2003 and developments in scientific areas such as vaccine research has also moved forwards.The deal does cover some remote unmodeled risks, such as the outbreak of an epidemic or the occurrence of a major tsunami. S&P also noted that there is uncertainty in the modelling as it is difficult to compare current mortality rates to historical rates due to medical advances and changes in lifestyle. A significant amount of the risk in this deal originates from the infectious disease model.RMS performed risk analysis by reconstructing historical events to see how they would impact the Atlas IX Capital mortality bond notes. RMS concluded that only a recurrence of the 1918 flu pandemic caused by a virus would result in complete losses of principal on both the Class A and B notes.

S&P believes that the biggest risks to this transaction are man-made catastrophes, such as a nuclear, chemical, or biological war or terrorist attack; a major natural catastrophe; or a substantial pandemic which has very limited vaccine or known treatment.On the construction of the mortality index and how the calculation agent will establish a mortality index value (MIV) Standard & Poor’s said:The MIV is defined on a rolling two-year period, and the probability of a loss attaching and the magnitude of the loss in principal depend on the extent to which the MIV for measurement period (that is, two consecutive years) exceeds the attachment point for the notes. Index values corresponding to future measurement periods are measured against the reference index value starting from the 2012 calendar year for the 50 states of the U.S. and District of Columbia only. Adjustments are applied for changes in mortality over the risk period. The MIV is constructed using published population mortality rates from The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, weighted by age and gender. The age and gender weights for the notes are fixed at inception and do not change during the risk period. The combined reduction in original principal for each payment date is the sum of loss percentages across all measurement periods in a risk period in the covered area for each class. This cannot exceed 100%. On a given payment date, the principal reduction amount is equal to the original principal amount, reduced by any amount already tendered, multiplied by the change in the combined principal reduction factor from the previous payment date.Update: The Atlas IX Capital mortality catastrophe bond grew in size by 40% to $175m while marketing. At the same time the pricing dropped and narrowed.The Class A tranche of notes launched with a preliminary size of $75m and offered investors a coupon in the range of 2.5% to 3.25%. This tranche remains at $75m in size and the price guidance has fallen to the bottom end of that range with expectations that it will close offering a 2.5% return to investors.The second, Class B, tranche of notes launched with a preliminary size of $50m and offering investors a coupon return in the range of 3.25% to 4%. This tranche has doubled in size to now offer $100m of notes and the price guidance has dropped to below the original range and narrowed to now offer an expected coupon in the range of 3% to 3.25%.Update 2: In an interesting turn of events, and slightly unsual for a cat bond issuance, this deal has now shrunk slightly and one tranche of notes has been pulled completely.The lower risk, Class A tranche of notes, has been pulled entirely and is no longer being offered to investors.The Class B tranche, which is higher risk and triggers at a mortality index value of 102% and as we wrote on Monday were offering a coupon of 3% to 3.25% for the upsized $100m of notes on offer has now been upsized even more. This tranche now offers $150m of notes, we understand, but the coupon guidance has been raised a little to 3.25% to 3.5%.So the transaction has shrunk to $150m from the $175m of notes which we last updated this entry with.We can’t be certain but it does look like investor interest in the lower risk, lower return, Class A notes has not been sufficient to get this tranche to market. For the Class B notes it appears that interest from investors remains but they have forced the coupon up a little.Update 3: The single tranche of Series 2013-1 Class B notes issued by Atlas IX Capital Ltd. ended up at $180m in size, meaning that it eventually secured all of the capacity it required but at the riskier, lower trigger tranche level (the tranche that was pulled from the issuance was lower risk, with a higher trigger). Pricing on the notes finished at 3.25%, which is the bottom of the range this tranche launched with.Gilles Meyer, Chief Executive Officer of SCOR Global Life, commented; ”The Series 2013-1 note offering of Atlas IX has created tremendous interest, enabling SCOR Global Life to secure substantial protection against its increased pandemic exposure following the strong growth of its portfolio, with the acquisition of Generali U.S. being the latest example. In combination with the innovation of an exceptionally low attachment point, the secured protection represents a very cost efficient risk mitigation tool.”Denis Kessler, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of SCOR, said; “Series 2013-1 of Atlas IX represents a first step in the implementation of SCOR’s recently released new three-year strategic plan “Optimal Dynamics”. The secured pandemic protection will in particular address two of the cornerstones of the SCOR group – a controlled risk appetite and a robust capital shield. In addition the transaction underlines the Group’s aim to leverage the increasing convergence between reinsurance and capital markets.”Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Zenkyoren is sponsor and cedent to this transaction, directly reinsuring itself through a contract with Namaka Re which will be collateralized through the sale of cat bond notes to investors. The Series 2013-1 issuance will seek to secure Zenkyoren at least $150m of cover for earthquakes across Japan and its islands and the protection will also cover it for tidal wave, fire, flood and sprinkler damage caused by earthquakes.This first issuance of $150m of notes will provide Zenkyoren with protection on a per occurrence basis and the trigger is an indemnity arrangement based on ultimate net loss suffered by Zenkyoren. The term of the Nakama Re cat bond is said to be for a three-year risk period.The transaction has a very high attachment point, according to our sources, which in turn equates into a relatively low risk cat bond which will protect Zenkyoren against the most severe earthquakes hitting Japan. The cat bond attachment point is at 1,650,000,000,000 JPY of losses to Zenkyoren (which is just over $16.9 billion) and the exhaustion point is at 1,750,000,000,000 JPY (or just under $17.93 billion). This does mean that Zenkyoren has a lot of room to upsize this cat bond if it wanted it to cover more of this layer of its reinsurance programme.The attachment probability is said to be 0.94% and the expected loss is 0.9%. We’re told that Nakama Re will be marketed with an expected coupon in the range of 2.5% to 3%, which reflects the remote risk associated with this deal.Given the high attachment point for this transaction it would take the most severe earthquakes to cause a loss to the holders of notes in Nakama Re. Even the 2011 Tohoku earthquake would have been unlikely to cause sufficient losses to affect this cat bond, had it been in place at the time.Update: The Nakama Re cat bond doubled in size while marketing.

The notes have a one year risk period, being due on the 5th of July 2014 but extendable until 1st August 2019 (presumably for loss development). The notes use an indemnity trigger based on the incurred losses under the ceded portfolio of risk that is included in the deal.The notes which have been listed on the Bermuda Stock Exchange feature the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) as the ceding insurer, meaning that the U.S. wind risk will be Texas-based from TWIA’s portfolio of risk, likely from the coastal region of Texas where hurricane impacts can be most severe.The notes have been structured as a zero coupon bond, which suggests that this transaction has been undertaken to suit an investor or collateralized source of capacity, which participated in TWIA’s recent mid-year reinsurance renewals but had a mandate to invest in insurance-linked securities with secondary liquidity, rather than just a collateralized reinsurance contract.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Northshore Re has been set up as a program and in this first issuance will place a single tranche of cat bond notes with investors to provide AXIS Capital subsidiary companies with a source of collateralized, capital market backed reinsurance protection. It is the first time AXIS Capital has issued a catastrophe bond.The transaction will ultimately protect a range of AXIS Capital subsidiaries, including (but not limited to) AXIS Specialty, AXIS Reinsurance, AXIS Insurance and AXIS Surplus. The Northshore Re cat bond will protect these AXIS Capital subsidiaries with a multi-year source of U.S. hurricane and earthquake reinsurance.The deal is being marketed offering a single tranche of Series 2013-1 Class A notes with a deal size of $150m, as with any cat bond that is a preliminary size and could grow. The cover provided to AXIS by the Northshore Re catastrophe bond will be on an annual aggregate basis using a PCS industry loss index which will be state-weighted and scaled by factors that depend on the state and are roughly proportional to AXIS’s market share.With this cat bond AXIS is looking for three years of protection. The hurricane protection is for the usual U.S. wind exposed states from the Gulf Coast round to the northeast. Earthquake coverage is for the entire U.S.Hurricane coverage is for losses in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia. Losses from earthquakes are covered across all 50 states and the District of Columbia.Based on AIR’s analysis, on a historical basis, there have been two years—1812 and 1906—that would have caused a modeled loss in excess of the attachment level. The 1812 events were the New Madrid earthquakes and the 1906 was the San Francisco earthquake.Standard & Poor’s noted: AIR’s inclusion of 10% of storm-surge losses might understate actual losses given that approximately 50% of the exposure in this deal comes from commercial policies, and flooding is commonly covered in this.The Northshore Re cat bond will provide its protection from an attachment point of $1 billion to an exhaustion point of $1.2 billion and that qualifying catastrophe events will only accumulate aggregate losses after a deductible of $50m is cleared. The attachment probability works out at 2.43% and the expected loss at 2.07%.Hurricane risks contribute 67% of the expected losses, with Florida and Texas the states with the most exposure. Earthquake risk is largely focused on California.At each of two annual resets, AXIS will be able to update the payout factors and the franchise deductible amounts subject to the conditions that no factor can exceed 40% and the franchise deductible must be at least $40m. The attachment point and exhaustion points will then be set to keep the probability of attachment and expected loss at 2.43% and 2.07%, respectively.Pricing wise sources explained that the deal was launched offering a coupon at a range of 7.5% to 8.5%.The collateral from the sale of the Northshore Re cat bond notes will be deposited in a collateral account and invested in U.S. Treasury money market funds.Update: This cat bond increased in size by 33% to $200m during the marketing phase. At the same time, the price guidance was reduced by almost 8% to a range of 7.25% to 7.5% before its close.Update 2: The pricing on the Northshore Re cat bond settled at the lowest end of the already reduced range, offering investors a coupon of 7.25%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(NYC MTA)","GC Securities is lead manager, joint structuring agent, and sole bookrunner and Goldman Sachs is co-senior manager and joint structuring agent","RMS","Storm surge (named storm induced)","$200m","Parametric","S&P: 'BB-'","Jul 2013","MetroCat Re Ltd., a Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurer established for issuing series of catastrophe bond notes, has been set up to support the risk transfer needs of First Mutual Transportation Assurance Co. (FMTAC), the New York State-licensed captive insurer and subsidiary of the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).This transaction provides cover just for storm surge, resulting from named storms.MetroCat Re Ltd. will issue a single tranche of Series 2013-1 notes, which will be sold to collateralized a reinsurance agreement between itself and First Mutual Transportation Assurance Co. (FMTAC). FMTAC will receive from the cat bond a three-year source of per-occurrence reinsurance protection against storm surge measured during named storm events on a parametric trigger basis.The single tranche of notes has a preliminary size of $125m we understand, although we’re told that the MTA could upsize this if pricing proves more attractive than other sources of reinsurance it utilises. The MTA’s motivation for issuing this cat bond is to expand and diversify its sources of reinsurance protection and also to obtain some coverage on a parametric basis which should payout more quickly than indemnity coverage.The transaction features a parametric trigger based on actual recorded storm surge heights from a number of zones around New York city. A loss payment would be due based upon a parametric event index meeting or exceeding a trigger level for an applicable area, meaning that it may not necessarily directly correlate with the losses of the sponsor.The notes offer protection against named storms that generate a storm surge event index that equals or exceeds 8.5 feet for Area A or 15.5 feet for Area B. Area A includes tidal gauges located in The Battery, Sandy Hook and Rockaway Inlet, while Area B includes tidal gauges in East Creak and Kings Point. A trigger event occurs when either Area’s event index calculated by RMS equals or exceeds the respective trigger levels. If a trigger event occurs, the loss payment from MetroCat to FMTAC will be 100% of the outstanding principal amount, so there is no sliding scale of loss here.In a pre-sale report, rating agency Standard & Poor’s said that risk modeller RMS’ data shows that The Battery and Kings Point are the two tidal gauges that are most correlated with the MTA’s exposure, so these locations have the highest weighting. Under hurricane Sandy these were the two areas that received the most flooding that entered subway and transit tunnels. Therefore, the MetroCat Re cat bonds parametric trigger structure has focused on catching storm surge levels at tidal gauges in these areas.The cat bond only covers storm surge from named storms, which must be tropical cyclones, tropical storm or hurricanes at some point in their lifespan. Extra-tropical cyclones are excluded, which means large storms forming in the northern Atlantic, such as the Great Nor’Easter of 1992, would not be covered.RMS, whose risk models are used for this cat bond, said that no non-hurricanes have ever caused storm surge levels that would have breached the parametric trigger. Based on their historical modelling analysis, there have been two hurricanes which would have breached the trigger level. Hurricane Donna (1960) generated a modelled storm surge height of 9.52 feet in Area A and Superstorm Sandy (2012) generated a modelled storm surge height of 10.93 feet in Area A. Both of these storms would have exceeded the MetroCat Re Area A trigger level.Storm surge data is collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for the tidal gauges at the Battery, Sandy Hook and Kings Point locations, and from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) for the Rockaway Inlet and East Creek tidal gauges.As well as using the tidal gauges that are already in place in these locations, either FMTAC or RMS will enter into an agreement with the USGS that they will deploy mobile storm surge gauges at each of the five locations as backup monitors. This is a good idea in the cat bond market and we could perhaps see other mobile data collection instruments used for other perils where there is any concern about data recording during an event.In the event of failure of the primary and back-up storm surge data recording, the data can be taken from high-water marks on permanent structures in the area. The permanent structure must be located on dry land and within 500 metres of the recording location.There is no annual reset for the transaction, neither will there be any changes to the recording zones weighting or any other factors. Area A contributes 45% of expected losses, while Area B contributes 22.6%. Areas A and B combined contribute 32.4% to expected losses. Hurricanes making landfall directly in New York state pose the greatest threat to the deal, according to the modelling. The modelled probability of attachment, expected loss and exhaustion are all 1.67% for the notes.S&P noted in the pre-sale report that this is the first storm surge cat bond it has rated and the first time it has rated a cat bond solely using RMS’ storm surge model. It also noted that data quality from historic events may not be as high quality as that from recent events such as Sandy, however there have been a number of events in the last few decades which have provided historical data. S&P also notes that two of the last three U.S. landfalling hurricanes did so in the U.S. northeast where the MetroCat Re cat bond is exposed.Credit exposure to the unrated FMTAC is mitigated because it will prepay the initial quarterly interest spread at closing of the cat bond and will prepay each subsequent quarterly interest spread 50 days before each payment date.The MetroCat Re 2013-1 cat bond notes are being marketed with a price guide range of 5% to 5.5%.Update: The MetroCat Re 2013-1 catastrophe bond increased in size by 60% to finish at $200m. Meanwhile the pricing on the transaction dropped to below the bottom of the original guidance range. pricing settled at 4.5%, down 14% from the mid-point of the original range.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Is a Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurer, registered in early July, for the purpose of issuing series of catastrophe bond notes for NJM. This first Class A tranche of Series 2013-1 cat bond notes issued by Sullivan Re came to market in July and will count towards Q3 2013 issuance figures.The Sullivan Re cat bond provides NJM with a three-year, fully-collateralized source of reinsurance protection for a single layer of its reinsurance program. The cat bond covers 20% of a $300m xs $300m reinsurance program for NJM.The cover provided by Sullivan Re is on a per-occurrence basis and the cat bond is structured using an indemnity trigger, linked to NJM’s losses in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.The Sullivan Re cat bond provides New Jersey Manufacturers with protection for losses caused by physical damage resulting from named storms to certain New Jersey and Pennsylvania personal line homeowners and auto insurance portfolios over a three year duration.The notes issued by Sullivan Re will not be listed on any stock exchange, but that doesn’t prevent them being actively, and widely traded in the secondary cat bond market. TWCM told Artemis that as with their other privately placed cat bond transactions, such as Oak Leaf Re, Sunshine Re and Skyline Re, the issued notes can be traded through TWCM itself or any other secondary cat bond brokerage.The Sullivan Re transaction uses U.S. Treasuries for collateral, as is typical of the majority of cat bonds. The transaction priced at 3.75% above the return of the U.S. Treasuries, a slight reduction from the initial pricing guidance demonstrating the demand shown for the transaction by investors.The Sullivan Re cat bond has been placed with a broad mix of global investors, both large and small and with differing strategies, according to TWCM. The investors self-modelled the risks of the transaction, meaning that no risk modelling costs for the transaction are passed on to the sponsor, helping to further reduce frictional costs on issuance.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The cat bond will provide the sponsors with a source of collateralized retrocessional reinsurance over a four-year risk period.The underlying reinsurance features a franchise deductible of $50m, meaning that qualifying events need to create losses above this level to aggregate towards the attachment point.The attachment point is said to be $875m while the exhaustion is said to be $1.125 billion. This equates to an attachment probability of 2.3%, an exhaustion probability of 1.52% and gives the deal an expected loss of 1.88%.The deal is being marketed with an interest guide range of 7% to 7.6%.The deal will cover personal and commercial property lines losses and also auto business losses. As an annual aggregate deal, events can qualify and losses will be aggregated during each annual period. If the total aggregated losses have not reached the attachment point by the end of the annual risk period then it will be reset, and losses start from zero again the next year.We understand that investors were pleased to see a RenaissanceRe sponsored cat bond being marketed more widely and the deal received strong support from a broad range of investors.The mix of investors the deal was placed with includes; dedicated ILS and catastrophe funds making up 61% of the cat bonds placement, hedge funds at 27%, larger institutional investors such as pension funds and endowments at 6%, other asset managers at 6% and reinsurers at 1%.

The deal allows for new subsidiaries or affiliates acquired by AIG during the term of the transaction to be included under the protection, as of the start of a new annual risk period, provided the ceded business is substantially similar to the subject business.The protection will be for named storms (so tropical storms and hurricanes) and also for earthquake risks. The earthquake protection also includes ensuing damage caused by ground-shaking, including fire following, sprinkler leakage, liquefaction, tsunami and ensuing flood that result in claims or liability in the covered area.The protection afforded is on a per-occurrence basis and the transaction uses an indemnity trigger based on AIG’s ultimate net losses. The transaction will cover AIG for a five-year risk period.The covered area for named storms is: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, as well as the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean (Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands, Bermuda, Puerto Rico, St. Maarten, St. Martin, Jamaica, Barbados, Cayman Islands, Dominican Republic, Trinidad and Tobago, Dominica, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Haiti, British Virgin Islands, Martinique, Montserrat, Netherlands Antilles, Aruba, St. Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Turks and Caicos, Antigua and Barbuda and St. Barts.The covered area for earthquakes is for all 50 states of the U.S., the District of Colombia and Canada.The transaction features a broad trigger, according to S&P, meaning that events which occur outside of the covered area, but that cause losses within the covered area, can qualify under the terms of the cat bond. This is a useful addition given the explicit inclusion of risks such as tsunami, as it means AIG’s losses from a tsunami affecting the U.S. coastline from an earthquake that could be thousands of miles away would still be covered.The Tradewynd Re cat bond covers a diverse and unusual book of AIG’s insurance business. Some of the lines of business covered are extremely unusual in the cat bond market or even completely new to cat bonds and have never been included in deals before. The subject business includes AIG policies which have exposure to losses caused by physical damage and time element coverages and contingent time element coverages, according to S&P.Time element coverages are largely business interruption related, items such as expenses, interruption costs, interest costs etc. This really broadens the potential for loss under the terms of the deal from a major catastrophe event, and makes the transaction about much more than just physical damage caused by an event, as the majority of cat bonds have always tended to be.Specific lines of business included are; commercial property, energy and engineering, aerospace, marine, the physical damage component of AIG’s programs division, and the property components of AIG’s personal lines operations. The personal lines book includes residential coverage across the U.S. and Caribbean as well as items such as high net worth residential, auto, yacht and fine art. The energy and engineering part of the commercial book includes items such as oil refining, chemical operations, power generation, utilities and power plants, mining above and below ground, construction coverage and offshore oil rig coverage for exploration and production of oil and natural gas.That’s an extremely broad book of business when you consider that the average cat bond includes commercial and personal residential properties, perhaps auto lines of business and some industrial risks. Including so many different lines of business makes it impossible to use any trigger other than an indemnity one and it is likely only now that investors have become so comfortable with indemnity triggers in cat bonds that a transaction like this has now become possible.Interestingly, S&P mentions some coverages which are not included in the AIR Worldwide risk modelling for the deal. It cites damage to airplanes, marine and inland marine cargo, onshore oil rigs, and clean-up costs from pollution caused by covered perils. That last item, clean-up costs from pollution, is particularly interesting as with oil, energy and chemical risks included in the deal it suggests an element of spill liability is covered here too.The explicit inclusion of the Gulf of Mexico is another important factor in this deal given the subject business includes energy and engineering risks such as oil exploration and drilling and the subject business also includes cargo, hull and recreational marine risks. This may be the first catastrophe bond to provide coverage for risks in the Gulf of Mexico itself.Commercial property lines of business contribute the largest percentage to the deals expected loss, at 61.3%, consumer lines are next at 29.4% of expected losses, followed by energy at 5.2% and specialty at 4.2%.The transaction, at its current size of $125m, will cover 25% of AIG’s losses between an attachment point of $4.5 billion and an exhaustion point of $5 billion. AIG is required to retain 5% of the ultimate net losses. The initial probability of attachment is 1.60%, expected loss is 1.43% and probability of exhaustion is 1.30%.The notes began marketing offering investors an interest spread guidance range of 7.25% to 8.25%.This Tradewynd Re cat bond features a variable reset feature which would allow the sponsor to adjust the protection the notes provide it. The attachment level can be adjusted within specified bounds, allowing the cover to move up or down the reinsurance tower and the interest spread would then be adjusted to compensate investors for either the increased or reduced risk. At each annual reset, of which there are four, the attachment probability must be between 1.2% and 2.2% and the interest spread paid to investors will fluctuate up or down accordingly, depending on AIG’s coverage needs.Based on AIR’s historical loss analysis, there have been two earthquakes which would have caused the Tradewynd Re cat bond to default. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake would result in $6.76 billion in losses and the 1812 New Madrid quake would result in $5.64 billion, both causing a full loss of investor principal. The analysis showed that there have been no named storms which would have caused a loss of principal, with the closest in terms of modelled ultimate net losses being $3.51 billion from the 1926 Great Miami Hurricane, $3.37 billion from the 1938 Great New England Hurricane, and $2.64 billion from Hurricane Andrew.The proceeds from the sale of the notes issued by Tradewynd Re will be deposited in a collateral account and invested in highly rated U.S. Treasury money-market funds.In a press release, AIG explained; “A diversified portfolio of risks is reinsured under the transaction. Commercial lines coverages include commercial property, energy and engineered risks, marine and aviation. Consumer lines coverages include high net worth residential, auto, yacht and fine art. To fund its potential obligations to AIG, Tradewynd Re Ltd. issued a five-year, $125 million single tranche catastrophe bond.”AIG seems committed to the catastrophe bond market as a source of reinsurance protection, saying; “AIG is a leader in the insurance-linked securities market, sponsoring $2 billion of cat bonds in the last three years. With this transaction, AIG is pleased to further advance capital market participation in insurance risks.”Update: The tranche of notes offered by Tradewynd Re has grown by 25% to $125m while marketing.At the same time the pricing has moved to the upper end of the original range, to 8.25%, which suggests that investors have demanded a higher coupon for this slightly unusual cat bond as it does contain some less well modelled exposures. That’s a multiple of 5.78.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

By line of business, agricultural and residential lines make up the bulk of the expected losses, accounting for 84% of the first years expected loss.The transaction uses an index trigger with an attachment level of 573m index points and an exhaustion level of 745m index points.The single tranche of notes has an attachment probability of 1.08%, an exhaustion probability of 0.66% and an expected loss of 0.85%. We’re told that the notes are being marketed with a coupon guidance price range of 2.75% to 3.25%.The transaction features a variable reset mechanism, which allows for the one year probability of attachment to be reset to a maximum of 1.6%. That would mean that the interest spread paid to investors would be changed so investors would be compensated for an increased, or reduced, risk of attachment.Green Fields II Capital will deposit the proceeds from the sale of the notes into a separate collateral account. It will then invest the collateral in European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Notes which are putable on the defined payment dates.We understand that when the risk modeller for this cat bond, RMS, ran historical storms through its model to analyse the potential for the notes to be triggered, none of the historical windstorms reached the index trigger point. We’re also told that simulated modelling showed that it could take a significant windstorm loss in France to breach the trigger on this deal, hence the relatively low coupon.Update: This deal increased in size by almost 87% to €280m (US$365m).

This 2013-1 issuance sees Assurant looking to expand its capital markets reinsurance protection for U.S. hurricane through three tranches of cat bond notes.The actual cedents for this deal are Assurant subsidiaries, American Security Insurance Co., American Bankers Insurance Co. of FL, Standard Guaranty Insurance Co., and Voyager Indemnity Insurance Co.The Ibis Re II 2013-1 cat bond is split into three tranches and is being marketed as offering $175m of notes, we understand from our sources. All three tranches are exposed to the same U.S. hurricane risk, across the main U.S. wind exposed states and also Puerto Rico.The covered area includes; Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.The cat bond uses an interesting reporting agency, one which is not utilised particularly often in the market, the Verisk Catastrophe Index. This means the trigger used will be a county-weighted industry loss index. The cover the notes afford Assurant will be on a per-occurrence basis.The Ibis Re 2012-1 cat bond was the first recorded in our Deal Directory to use the Verisk Catastrophe Index. The Verisk catastrophe index reports, through which the industry loss data is reported, show insured losses on a county level multiplied by predetermined county payout factors (weighting) for personal, commercial and auto lines of business.The Verisk county-weighted, line of business based approach to loss reporting clearly suits Assurants portfolio, hence utilising it again. For this deal the trigger is based on personal line of business losses only.The three tranches of notes are all relatively focused on Florida hurricane risk, with the state of Florida making up the largest contribution to the expected losses of each tranche.The Class A tranche of notes have an initial size of $100m, an attachment probability of 0.79%, an expected loss of 0.73% and an exhaustion probability of 0.65% and are the least risky notes. The Class B notes are currently $35m in size, have an attachment probability of 2.02%, an expected loss of 1.35% and an exhaustion point of 0.88%. The Class C notes are riskiest, currently sized at $40m, have an attachment probability of 4.12%, an expected loss of 2.98% and an exhaustion point of 2.04%.All three tranches of notes will be sold to collateralized an index-based risk transfer via reinsurance agreement to provide protection on a per-occurrence basis over a 3-year risk period to the ceding insurers against hurricane in the covered area.At the currently marketed tranche sizes, the class A notes will cover 50% of losses between an initial attachment point of $1.86 billion and an initial exhaustion point of $2.06 billion. The class B notes cover 5% of losses between an initial attachment point of $1.06 billion and an initial exhaustion point of $1.76 billion, and the class C notes cover 10% of losses between an initial attachment point of $660 million and an initial exhaustion point of $1.06 billion.The Class A notes are being marketed with a coupon guidance interest spread of 3.5% to 4%, the Class B notes are being offered with an interest range of 4.5% to 5.25% and the Class C notes are offering a spread of 8% to 8.75%. We expect to see a modicum of tightening on these as pricing is finalised, however they do look reasonable given the risk profile and current market appetite.Risk modelling of historical hurricanes showed that no known storms would have reached the attachment point for the Class A, least risky notes. For the Class B Notes, the 1926 “no-name” hurricane (which made landfall in Florida and Alabama) and 1992′s Hurricane Andrew would have generated principal losses of 100% and 13% respectively on the Class B tranche of notes. The Class C notes would have been affected by those two storms and also the 1928 “no-name” Florida hurricane, with the three events causing principal losses of 100%, 100% and 60% respectively.While the contribution from Puerto Rico to expected losses has risen over the 2012 Ibis Re cat bond, it is still very low compared to Florida which is where much of the risk from this cat bond lies. Puerto Rico contributes only 5.5% for the Class A notes, 9% for the Class B notes, and 10.1% for Class C notes, to expected losses, whereas the contribution to expected loss from Florida is 80.4% (class A), 75.0% (class B), and 66.9% (class C).Collateral from the sale of the Ibis Re II notes will be deposited in a reinsurance trust account, for each class of notes, and invested in one or more Treasury money-market funds. The collateral and trust accounts will be managed by Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Americas.At the annual reset there are limitations to how much the risk profile of the deal can change with respect to expected losses in different U.S. states. The modeled contribution to expected losses for Florida will not be less than 65% for the Class A notes, 60% for the Class B notes, and 50% for the Class C notes.Update: This cat bond increased in size slightly before close, to $185m. he other two tranches remain the same size, at $35m for the Class B notes and $40m for the Class C notes.The Class A notes increased from $100m to $110m. Pricing actually increased on this tranche slightly. The Class A, tranche began marketing with price guidance coupon range of 3.5% to 4%, but at the latest update the slightly larger tranche is now being offered with a 4% interest coupon, an increase in pricing of 6.7% from the mid-point of the original range.The Class B notes have priced down from the original range of interest range of 4.5% to 5.25% to now be offered at a coupon of 4.5%, the lower end of the original range, a drop of 7.7% on pricing from the mid-point of the original range. The Class C notes launched with a price guide range of 8% to 8.75% and that has dropped to the bottom end of the range at 8%, a 4.5% reduction from the original price guide mid-point.Update 2: The deal completed with no further changes to the above pricing.S&P said, on rating the deal, “The class A notes will cover 55% of losses between the initial attachment point of $1.86 billion and the initial exhaustion point of $2.06 billion. The class B notes will cover 5% of losses between the initial attachment point of $1.06 billion and the initial exhaustion point of $1.76 billion, and the class C notes will cover 10% of losses between the initial attachment point of $660 million and $1.06 billion.”Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The sale of the notes will provide a source of fully-collateralized, retrocessional reinsurance protection to Munich Re for the perils of U.S. hurricanes and Australian cyclones.We’re told that the deal is being marketed with a suggested size of $75m, but clearly given the appetite for new cat bond issues that could grow.We understand that the coverage provide by Queen Street VIII Re will be on a per-occurrence basis over three years and that both perils will use a type of industry loss index trigger.The trigger for U.S. hurricane risks is a county and line of business weighted PCS industry loss index, while the trigger for Australian cyclone risks is a weighted modelled industry loss index.Hurricane coverage is for personal, commercial and auto losses in the U.S. states of Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia.Australian tropical cyclone coverage is for the whole Commonwealth of Australia, for residential, commercial, agricultural and auto lines of business.Interestingly, these two perils are at their peaks at opposite ends of the year, meaning that for the summer months U.S. hurricane risk will be the main threat, while over the winter Australian cyclones will be the risk that worries investors.The way the deal is structured Australian cyclone risk actually makes up just over half of the first years expected loss calculation.When AIR performend historical event scenario modelling for this deal, one hurricane caused losses to the notes, the 1926 unnamed Florida storm could have caused a loss of 35% of the notes principal. Australian Cyclone Tracy in 1974, the only Australian historical storm that would have threatened the notes, could have caused a complete loss of principal for noteholders on a modelled basis.We’re told that the attachment probability for the notes is 3.91%, the exhaustion probability is 1.88% and the expected loss is 2.72%. The expected coupon price guidance range is from 6.75% to 7.5%.Proceeds of the sale of the notes will be invested in highly rated U.S. treasury or money-market fundsUpdate: The price guidance on this issuance dropped to below the lower end of the marketed range to 6.5% to 7% before the deal priced.Update 2: Before this deal closed the pricing dropped again to finish at the bottom of the adjusted range at 6.5%.The initial expected loss for the notes is 2.72% so pricing was at a multiple of approximately 2.4 times expected losses.Sponsor Munich Re said that investors appreciated the diversifying effect of Australian cyclone risks in this cat bond.Munich Re Board member Thomas Blunck said; “Munich Re has again used the current market environment to acquire coverage for the peak risk US hurricane and included Australian cyclone risk for the first time for protection of our own book. The response by investors has been positive. Investors appreciate the transparent risk/return profile and the diversifying effect of Australian cyclone exposure.”Munich Re explained that the deal provides cover for extreme events with a statistical return period of between 65 and 80 years per event. The Australian cyclone coverage is largely focused on exposures in the territory of Queensland which constitute the majority of the initial expected losses for that peril.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The Class 3 notes have an attachment probability of 4.75%, an expected loss of 3.26% and an exhaustion probability of 2.27%.The $155m Class 11 annual aggregate tranche cover a percentage of losses between an attachment point of $1.075 billion and an exhaustion point of $1.593 billion. These notes have an attachment probability of 4.55%, an expected loss of 2.1%, an exhaustion probability of 0.85%.The Class 11 notes are less risky despite having a lower attachment point because they have a franchise deductible applied, so that only events causing an ultimate net loss of $50m or greater can be aggregated towards the trigger point. The Class 3 notes do not have a franchise deductible but do require USAA to retain at least 10% of losses from its occurrence layer of reinsurance.Historical loss modelling for the Class 3 per-occurrence notes show that one historical hurricane and three historical earthquakes generated ultimate losses that would have reached the attachment point for that tranche; the 1938 “Northeast Clipper” hurricane ($1.626 billion), the 1906 San Francisco earthquake ($1.972 billion), the 1812 New Madrid earthquake ($1.828 billion), and the 1886 Charleston earthquake ($1.502 billion). None of these events would have reached the exhaustion point however, so only would have caused a partial loss of principal to investors.For the Class 11 aggregate notes we understand that no single year on record has seen aggregate ultimate net losses high enough to breach the attachment point.The U.S. hurricane and tropical cyclone covered area includes the following states; Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Earthquake coverage is for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. However, losses caused by fire following will not be covered in Hawaii or Alaska. Severe thunderstorms and winter storms coverage is for the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Wildfire protection is in California only.Reporting agencies used for each peril are the National Hurricane Center for U.S. hurricane and tropical cyclones, the U.S. Geological Survey for earthquakes and Property Claims Services (PCS) for severe thunderstorm, winter storm and wildfire. With PCS acting as reporting agency it means that for an event to qualify for those perils it would have to have been designated a catastrophe event by PCS.The proceeds from the sale of the two tranches of notes will be deposited in a reinsurance trust account and then invested in highly rated Treasury or Federal money-market funds.The Class 3 tranche of notes are being marketed with a coupon guidance range of 9.75% to 10.5%.The Class 11 tranche of notes are being marketed with a coupon guidance range of 8.5% to 9.5%Update: During the marketing stage of this deal the transaction increased in size from $250m to $300m. The Class 3 notes remained at $95m but the Class 11 notes grew from $155m to $205m in size.At the same time the price guidance for the notes was reduced. The Class 3 notes began marketing with a coupon range of 9.75% to 10.5% but are now being offered with a range of 9.25% to 9.75%. The Class 11 notes have experienced a similar drop in pricing, reducing from the original range of 8.5% to 9.5% to now offer a spread range of 8% to 8.5%.Update 2: The pricing on this transaction dropped to the bottom end of the already reduced ranges. The Class 3 notes priced at the bottom of the reduced range at 9.25%. That’s a drop in the risk spread on these notes of approximately -9% from the mid-point of the originally marketed range.The Class 11 notes also priced at the lower end of the reduced range, at 8%.

This will replace and expand the cover it had from soon to mature Blue Fin 3 cat bond.The actual counterparty for the deal is Allianz Argos 14 GmbH, a subsidiary of the Allianz group of companies. In this deal Blue Danube II Ltd. will issue a single tranche of notes to collateralize risk transfer contracts which will provide Allianz Argos 14 GmbH with a multi-year source of fully collateralized reinsurance protection on a per-occurrence basis.The deal will provide reinsurance protection against hurricanes or named storms in the U.S., the majority of the Caribbean and Central America including Mexico. The deal will also provide protection against earthquake risks in the U.S. and all provinces of Canada. The deal term will be for three years with maturity expected in May 2016. Coverage is for both personal and commercial line losses.U.S. hurricane coverage is for named storms in 31 states, which we understand to be; AL, AR, CT, DC, DE, FL, GA, HI, IL, IN, KY, LA, ME, MD, MA, MS, MO, NH, NJ, NY, NC, OH, OK, PA, RI, SC, TN, TX, VT, VA, WV.Caribbean and Central American hurricane coverage is for named storms in; Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, The Cayman Islands, Costa Rica, Dominica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Montserrat, Netherlands Antilles, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico, St. Maarten, Trinidad & Tobago, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.U.S. earthquake coverage is for the 50 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Canadian earthquake coverage is for all Canadian provinces.The Blue Danube II cat bond uses two types of modelled industry loss triggers. The transaction uses the Modelled Industry Trigger Transaction (MITT), which takes industry loss estimates for the U.S. and weights them after the event against certain applicable modelled portfolios, and also a standard modelled loss trigger depending on the region.The MITT trigger, developed by reinsurer Swiss Re and used in Allianz’s Blue Danube Ltd. cat bond last year, is for domestic U.S. hurricane and earthquake risks. The modelled loss trigger is being used for the other regions that this cat bond covers for hurricane risks, so most of the Caribbean and certain Central American countries including Mexico.Property Claims Services (PCS) is providing industry loss estimate data for the transaction, we assume just for the U.S. hurricane and earthquake perils as PCS does not cover the Caribbean or Central America.This data will be fed into the risk model to calculate index values using certain weighting factors for the MITT trigger perils and the calculation agent then determines whether an event has breached the modelled industry index trigger level.For the Caribbean and Mexico a more typical modelled loss calculation will be undertaken to calculate the event loss amount, using the notional portfolio. National Hurricane Center and USGS data will be used for the two perils of hurricane and earthquake.The cat bond notes will cover losses between an event index value of 148.3 and 182.9 on a per-occurrence basis in the first risk period.According to historical loss modelling, the only event on record which would have caused the Class A notes to be triggered was the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.The modelled attachment probability for the notes in the first year is 1.21%, the modelled expected loss is 0.96% and the modelled exhaustion probability is 0.73%.The proceeds from the sale of the notes issued by Blue Danube II will be invested in IBRD floating-rate notes.This deal launched with a price guidance range of 4.75% to 5.5%, we understand, but we’re now told that this has been reduced today down to a range of 4.25% to 4.75%, so it will price below the originally marketed range. We don’t know whether the deal has increased in size at this time, we’re told it is still being marketed as $150m of notes today.Update: This cat bond grew slightly in size to $175m by the time it finally priced.

This organisation is the insurer to the Florida League of Cities, which looks after the interests of Florida municipal governments.The cat bond coverage has been designed to dovetail with an existing layer of traditional reinsurance. The transaction effectively sees FMIT take a portion of its penultimate excess-of-loss layer of traditional reinsurance protection and on a pro-rata basis transfer it to the capital markets.The remainder of that reinsurance layer provides one-year protection, so by leveraging the capital markets FMIT has successfully extended that layer of its reinsurance tower to include multi-year protection.TWCM said that the portion of this layer transferred to the capital markets achieved attractive pricing for multi-year collateralized cover.Given the municipal nature of the sponsor, the underlying book of property consists of governmental and municipal buildings, which is interesting as it perhaps offers a small element of diversification when compared to all other Florida wind or hurricane cat bonds which consist of residential homeowners and commercial properties.There was no risk modelling agency used for this deal as investors undertook their own risk modelling.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

This deal will see Long Point Re III Ltd. issue a single tranche of Series 2013-1 cat bond notes, which has a preliminary size of $150m, designed to protect it against hurricanes in northeastern U.S. states on an indemnity and per-occurrence basis.The actual beneficiaries of the cat bond protection are the Travelers Indemnity Co., Travelers Casualty and Surety Co., St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co., and The Standard Fire Insurance Co., together with direct and indirect insurance subsidiaries.The covered business is from Travelers personal-lines and commercial-lines insurance business. The commercial-lines business is a mix of Travelers’ select accounts (small business policies) and commercial accounts (midsize business policies). Business units that cover large and unique exposures, complex financial structures, and mobile property have been excluded from the subject business.The covered area is; Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.The 2013-1 tranche of cat bond notes are riskier than last years 2012-1 issuance. The 2012 deal had an Ultimate Net Loss (UNL) attachment point of $2 billion, while this 2013 cat bond has an attachment point of $1.25 billion and an exhaustion point of $1.8 billion. The is a limit of $20m loss per risk.The attachment probability for the notes will be 1.416% in the first year, while the exhaustion probability will be 0.952% and the expected loss 1.159%. The 2012 deal had an attachment probability of 0.89%, a probability of exhaustion of 0.71% and an expected loss of 0.81%.This 2013-1 deal covers 54.55% of a layer beneath the Long Point Re III Ltd. (Series 2012-1) which attaches at $2 billion of losses.The transaction will have a term of three years, with maturity expected in May 2016. We understand that the reinsurance transaction that underlies this cat bond also includes a clause that will see Travelers retain 10% of any qualifying losses.GC Securities, who acted as joint bookrunner on this transaction, noted that the deal enhanced the protection that Travelers receives from the capital markets through the addition of a number of new features which provide flexibility to the sponsor. This includes an expanded definition of hurricanes, this has been worded to include and storm reported by any agency at any time to be a hurricane and also includes storms which may merge with other systems. This new definition would ensure that the cat bond covered a storm such as hurricane Sandy.We also understand from sources that this Long Point Re III cat bond has provisions for a variable reset which allows the sponsor, Travelers, to adjust the trigger amount as long as the expected loss remains between 1% and 1.5%. If Travelers chose to do that we assume that the coupon that investors will be paid would be adjusted to reflect the increased risk as well.If Travelers choose to use the variable reset the UNL attachment point could move to as low as $930 million.The bond also features a call option allowing Travelers to redeem the cat bond, for a small above par penalty. This would allow the insurer to swap the cover back to traditional reinsurance sources if the pricing was attractive enough to offset the penalty.Standard & Poor’s explained in it’s pre-sale report; “The call option also affects the selection of an attachment point when there is volatility in reinsurance prices. Travelers can redeem the bond at 103% of par after year 1 and at 102% of par after year 2. When prices drop by enough to absorb these penalties and offset their transaction costs, Travelers has an incentive to call the bond. Conversely, when reinsurance prices rise, Travelers would like to see this bond cover as much of its losses as possible. Although its coupon would rise if more risk were pushed into the layer, the magnitude of the coupon adjustment is based on current market conditions. Thus, Travelers would find this bond a comparatively good deal and would want more losses covered by the structure. This means lowering the attachment point and setting the bond’s expected losses at the upper end of the permissible range.”One historical event could have caused a total loss of principal to the notes, 1938’s “Northeast Clipper” that made landfall initially in New York, with losses that would have reached the attachment level. The AIR estimated net loss from this event was $2.566 billion, which would have resulted in a total loss of principal.Long Point Re III will deposit the proceeds from the sale of the notes into a reinsurance trust account. These must be invested in assets according to a stated priority. The first category in which funds must be invested subject to availability is money-market funds domiciled in the U.S. that invest solely in treasury obligations and that are rated ‘AAAm’ by Standard & Poor’s on the issuance date and are not subject to U.S. or foreign withholding tax.Update: This cat bond deal doubled in size to $300m while marketing and the pricing dropped to the bottom end of the marketed range to 4%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

It has been registered for the purpose of issuing series of catastrophe bond notes, of which this Series 2013-1 issuance is the first.Armor Re Ltd. is seeking to issue a Series 2013-1 tranche of cat bond notes to secure Florida wind and hurricane protection for Florida focused insurer of commercial residential properties, and first-time cat bond sponsor, American Coastal Insurance Company.With this deal American Coastal Insurance is seeking to secure a source of fully-collateralized reinsurance protection using an indemnity trigger with a one-year risk period. The risk period is expected to run from the 1st June until the end of May 2014. Coverage is for named Florida storms, so tropical cyclones, storms and hurricanes given names by the National Hurricane Center.The protection provided by Armor Re will be from named storms which affect the underlying book of commercial residential property insurance business.The cat bond is being marketed with an initial size of $125m and will provide a percentage of cover on a $200m top-layer of the reinsurance tower.The layer of protection provided by Armor Re Ltd. sits above American Coastal Insurance’s reinsurance tower including reinsurance cover from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Facility. These reinsurance layers are inured to the layer that Armor Re covers, we understand, but the private reinsurance layers do not have reinstatement provisions meaning that they can be eroded by storms, with no automatic reinstatement. It appears that depending on whether the sponsor chose to replace an eroded layer of non-reinstating reinsurance, the attachment point for the Armor Re cat bond could effectively be lowered as the reinsurance layers beneath were removed.The notes cover losses between an initial attachment point of $913m ($75m net of reinsurance as there is a $75m layer of retention at the foot of the reinsurance tower) and the exhaustion point of $1.113 billion ($275m net of reinsurance).The initial probability of attachment is 0.42%, initial expected loss is 0.34% and the initial probability of exhaustion is 0.3%.Risk modeller AIR Worldwide performed a historical loss analysis and found that there had not been any individual events or indeed years which would have seen losses reach the attachment point and trigger a loss to noteholders. Because of the composition of the underlying book of business the risk of attachment for this cat bond is relatively remote.The storms that caused the greatest estimate of gross losses, including loss adjustment expense, were the no-name storm of 1928 in Florida causing estimated losses of $291m; the no-name storm of 1926 that impacted Florida and Alabama causing estimated losses of $270.4m; and the no-name storm of 1947 affecting Florida and Louisiana and causing estimated losses of $268m. Those three years are the years with the highest total losses on a modelled basis, no other years with multiple qualifying storms reached the level of losses seen in 1947, according to S&P’s report.In terms of contribution to expected loss, the majority of the risk is attributed to apartments and condominiums, primarily of masonry construction. Palm Beach, Pinellas, Collier, Sarasota and Lee counties in Florida are the top five counties in terms of expected loss.Proceeds from the sale of the cat bond notes will be held in a collateral account and invested in U.S. treasury money-market funds which are highly rated. Bank Of New York Mellon are acting as indenture trustee and reinsurance account trustee.This is a reasonably low-risk cat bond deal. As a result the price guidance is not that high for Florida wind, we’re told Armor Re is being marketed with a coupon range of 4.75% to 5.5% above the return of the money-market funds.S&P notes that credit risk for this deal is mitigated as American Coastal will prepay the quarterly insurance premium for the entire risk period at the deals closing. S&P also notes that if there is a potential covered event, American Coastal will pay servicer fees in advance. These are important points for investors and will help make investors more comfortable with the deal from a new cat bond sponsor.Update: This cat bond grew to $183m during marketing, although it still targets $200m we believe. The pricing guidance on the transaction was reduced down to 4.25% to 5%.Update 2: The pricing closed at the lower end of the already reduced range at 4.25%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The sale of the notes will collateralize the reinsurance agreement between Pelican Re and LA Citizens, with the reinsurance providing protection from hurricane losses on a per-occurrence basis and using an indemnity UNL trigger. The term of the cat bond cover is over a four year duration.Coverage will protect LA Citizens from losses within its Coastal and Fair plan books of business. Both the Coastal and Fair plans contain residential and commercial properties, although we understand that the covered business is predominantly residential in nature.The transaction will use an initial attachment point of $389m of ultimate net loss to the covered business and an initial exhaustion point of $539m we understand. That equates to an initial attachment probability of 2.29% and an initial expected loss of 1.88%. The deal is being marketed with a coupon or interest spread range of 7% to 7.5%.This puts the cover from the 2013 cat bond above the 2012 layer, which attaches at $200m. That means this new cat bond is less risky than the 2012 deal.The structure of Pelican Re 2013-1 will allow the sponsor to adjust the reinsurance layer that the deal provides by opting to reset the attachment point. This is effectively a drop down facility, the coverage can be dropped down the reinsurance tower, but at the sponsors request rather than after a triggering event or loss.Louisiana Citizens will be able to request an ‘optional reset’ at any time after the first risk period is over we’re told which will enable it to lower the attachment point, thus increasing the probability of attachment and expected loss of the notes and also increasing the coupon paid to investors.The coverage layer can only be moved within pre-defined limits and the transaction has a maximum attachment probability figure of 4.73% which we understand would be at $193m according to the modelling, a maximum expected loss of 3.26% and we’re told also a maximum possible coupon price range of 10% to 10.75%.AIR Worldwide has modelled a number of historical events against this deal and we understand that three hurricanes were shown to cause a 100% loss to the notes no matter where the layers attachment was set at the time, including Katrina from 2005.Update: We understand that this cat bond is likely to upsize to $140m before close.The initial price guidance has been reduced to 6.50% to 7.00% while the maximum price guidance has been reduced to 9.75% to 10.00%.Update 2: The pricing on this cat bond dropped again before close, finishing with an initial coupon of 6% and a maximum coupon of 9.25%.

The reinsurance coverage provided by the cat bond will protect Allstate Insurance Co. and a number of its affiliates.In this Series 2013-1 issuance Sanders Re Ltd. will secure Allstate a source of fully-collateralized reinsurance protection for covered U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes, including fire following, on a per-occurrence basis over a four-year risk period. The transaction uses an industry loss index trigger, with PCS catastrophe series industry loss estimates providing the data on covered events. The industry loss trigger is a modified, due to state-payout factors, PCS index-based industry loss trigger.The transaction is being marketed with an initial size of $250m and is split into two tranches of notes. The Class A tranche of notes are sized at $100m at launch and will cover 66.67% of losses between an initial attachment point of $3.25 billion and an initial exhaustion point of $3.55 billion. The Class B tranche of notes are sized at $150m at launch and will cover 30% of losses between an initial attachment point of $2.75 billion up to where the Class A notes kick in at $3.25 billion.The Class B notes are riskier, attaching further down in Allstate’s reinsurance tower. Class A has an attachment probability of 0.93%, an expected loss of 0.84% and probability of exhaustion of 0.77%, while Class B has an attachment probability of 1.20%, an expected loss of 1.08% and probability of exhaustion of 0.93%.Coverage U.S. hurricanes is in the following specified States; Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.Coverage for U.S earthquake and fire-following is more limited, being just in California, New York and Washington.Based on historical catastrophe event analysis by the risk modeller on the cat bond AIR Worldwide, there haven’t been any historical events which would have caused modelled losses in excess of the attachment level of each class of notes. The three historical events which came closest to triggering the cat bond are $2.617 billion from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, $2.444 billion from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (loss amount includes covered states only), and $2.4 billion from an unnamed storm in 1938 that made landfall in New York.Proceeds from the sale of the two tranches of notes will be deposited in reinsurance trust accounts and then invested in highly rated U.S. Treasury money-market funds.Pricing wise, this deal is being marketed to investors with a coupon range of 3.75% to 4.75% for the Class A notes and 4.35% to 5% for the Class B notes.It’s worth speculating about how large this cat bond could get. The attachment point of Class B, at $2.75 billion, all the way up to the exhaustion point of Class A, at $3.55 billion, is an $800m layer of Allstate’s reinsurance protection.The cat bond markets investors certainly have the capital and the appetite to help Allstate turn those as yet undefined percentages of coverage into 100% for both layers. It will be interesting to see how large Allstate take this deal.However it’s worth pointing out that our sources told us that the offering documents distributed by the brokers of this deal state that the Class B tranche will not increase in size.Update: The Sanders Re cat bond is set to increase in size after it grew during marketing. The Class A tranche is now being marketed at $150m to $200m in size, up from the $100m it launched at. The Class B notes have not changed in size.The pricing on both tranches has dropped during marketing. The Class A notes are now marketing with a coupon price guide of 3.5% and the Class B notes have price guidance of 4%, down by 17% and 14% from the mid-point of the originally marketed ranges.Update 2: The size of the deal was confirmed at $350m, with the Class A tranche at $200m and Class B at $150m.Prcing was confirmed as above.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

GC Securities are co-structurer and bookrunner.","RMS","Turkey earthquake","$400m","Parametric","S&P: 'BB+'","Apr 2013","This catastrophe bond is being issued on behalf of the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool, a state backed insurer which pools catastrophe exposure.Bosphorus 1 Re Ltd. is a Bermuda registered special purpose insurer, registered on the island on the 11th January 2013.The transaction seeks to provide the TCIP with a three year source of fully-collateralized earthquake reinsurance cover on a per-occurrence basis. The notes will provide reinsurance cover for earthquakes affecting primarily the Istanbul region of Turkey.The transaction uses a parametric trigger, so the cat bond would be triggered by actual earthquake measurements and ground movement, with RMS providing the risk modelling.Bosphorus 1 Re is seeking to issue a single tranche of Series 2013-1 Class A notes with a preliminary size of $100m.Risk Management Solutions (RMS) are the risk modeller for the transaction and will use RMS’s Europe Earthquake Model for Turkey, which rating agency Standard & Poor’s note is the first time this model has been used in a rated cat bond transaction.The reporting agency for the transaction, who will provide actual earthquake measurement data to be input into the RMSmodel, is Bogazici University’s Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute (KOERI). The parametric loss trigger is based on data reported by KOERI, or a back-up agency.For an event to qualify as ‘covered’ under the terms of the cat bond it must be an earthquake with a date of loss during the cat bond risk period and it must result in a spectral acceleration greater than 0.1g for at least 10% of the defined calculation locations, as confirmed by the calculation agent.If the data is not available after an event, or does not meet data criteria, the calculation agent will source alternative data from sources such as the USGS ShakeMap.An event index value will be calculated. If the resulting event index value is above the attachment level then a payment will be due to TCIP, how much that payment would be will depend on another calculation of the event index value versus the attachment and exhaustion levels.According to RMS’ risk analysis there have been two historical events which it believes could have reached the index attachment point, one in 1509 and another in 1766, according to S&P. However, S&P notes that due to the uncertainty in historical earthquake data the events actual intensity is hard to confirm from the documentation available at the time.While the cat bond does focus on the capital of Turkey Istanbul for its coverage area, it is not solely focused on Istanbul itself. We understand that the calculation locations are spread around the Istanbul area, including some coastal regions, so a large enough quake outside Istanbul has a remote chance of triggering the parametric factors if 10% of the calculation locations are sufficiently impacted.The probability of attachment for the notes is 1.10%, the probability of exhaustion is 0.91% and the expected loss is 1.01%. On a cumulative basis the probability of attachment for year 1 of the deal is 1.10%, for year 2 2.18% and for year 3 it is 3.25%. We understand from our sources that the initial index attachment level is 2,156 and the initial index exhaustion level is 2,412.The collateral from the sale of the notes will be deposited into a collateral account and then transferred to one or more highly rated U.S. Treasury money-market funds managed by MEAG MUNICH ERGO Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH. S&P note that funds in the collateral account were initially invested in a money market fund, MEAG Bosphorus 1/I, set up especially for this transaction and managed by MEAG MUNICH ERGO Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH.TCIP will pre-pay 190 days of premium payments into a separate deposit account to ensure scheduled premium payments can be made even if the transaction was stopped before the end of the term if TCIP failed to pay its reinsurance premium.At reset there is the ability for new calculation locations to be added to this deal. This could allow TCIP to broaden the geographic region that the transaction covers by including calculation locations further outside Istanbul, a particularly useful feature in a country such as Turkey where development levels differ depending on location.The transaction is being marketed with a coupon range of 2.75% to 3.25%.Update: The Bosphorus 1 Re Ltd. catastrophe bond has upsized by 150% to now be issuing $250m of notes on behalf of TCIP.The price guidance coupon range has dropped during marketing to below the bottom end of the originally marketed range at 2.50% – 2.75%.Update 2: The Bosphorus cat bond has increased in size again, leaping to $400m in size before it priced.At the same time the pricing dropped to the bottom of the already reduced range to finish at 2.50%.This deal has grown in size by 300% and the pricing has dropped by around 17% while it was marketed, making the reinsurance cover it provides very cost-effective for the sponsor.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Munich Re are co-structuring and co-lead managing the deal.","RMS","North Carolina hurricane","$500m","Indemnity","S&P: 'B+'","Apr 2013","Tar Heel Re Ltd. is a Bermuda domiciled SPI seeking to issue cat bond notes designed to support the North Carolina wind pools the North Carolina Joint Underwriters Assn. (NCJUA) and the North Carolina Insurance Underwriters Assn. (NCIUA) with a source of hurricane reinsurance protection. The cover is afforded via a reinsurance agreement with Munich Reinsurance America.Munich Reinsurance America are sponsoring the deal and are entering into a retrocessional reinsurance contract with the issuer, Tar Heel Re Ltd. but the cover is linked to the actual loss experience of the NCJUA and NCIUA rather than Munich Re’s own exposure in North Carolina. So the cat bond covers the reinsurance agreement between Munich Re America and the two non-profit wind pools.What’s interesting about this cat bond is the change to the structure with a new way to qualify a storm as an event under the terms of the deal. All of the NCJUA / NCIUA cat bonds have been pure indemnity trigger deals, linked to the actual loss experience for storms affecting the state of North Carolina.The Tar Heel Re 2013-1 cat bond issuance features a different way to define whether a storm is a covered event or not under the terms of the cat bond. Not only does it have to be a named storm which causes a loss to the covered book of business, it also has to have been designated a catastrophe by Property Claims Services (PCS) and it has to have a reported industry loss total of over $100m.The transaction uses an annual aggregate structure which is the first time these non-profit wind pools have done so, with the previous deals all pure indemnity and triggered only on a per-occurrence basis.By making these changes the wind pools will have a more robust layer of protection for frequency events hitting the state of North Carolina, safe in the knowledge that catastrophe events must be large enough to create the $100m industry loss as well as cause indemnity losses to the covered parties.The changes may also have enabled the coverage to be brought down a little in the overall reinsurance stack without raising the risk too much, while also enabling the expected loss figure to be kept more reasonable, evidenced by the attachment point being lower than in their previous transactions.We understand that the notes issued by Tar Heel Re Ltd. will attach around the $2.025 billion mark and will provide cover on a pro-rata basis, depending on the size of the deal, up to an exhaustion point of $2.525 billion.The initial probability of attachment for the notes is 2.08%, the initial exhaustion probability is 1.52% and the initial expected loss is 1.77%.We understand the cat bond has been marketed at a size of $200m but demand thanks to current market conditions could well push this figure up. The deal aims to provide three years of cover, with maturity likely in May 2016 and will feature a reset of the aggregate qualifying losses on a yearly basis.RMS are providing the risk modelling and to see them involved in a U.S. hurricane cat bond is quite a novelty after the way they dropped from sight following the release of RMS v11.We’re told that the single tranche of notes are being marketed with a suggested price guidance of 9% to 10%.Standard & Poor’s have given the Series 2013-1 notes to be issued by Tar Heel Re Ltd. a preliminary rating of ‘B+’. In their announcement on the rating, S&P said that the fact RMS are acting as risk modeller did create the need to assess this a little differently. S&P said; “Because of the significant difference between the AIR and RMS modeled losses, the stress rate applied to the aggregate exceedence probability curve was higher as compared to the indicative level for indemnified transactions set forth in our criteria.”Update: Tar Heel Re Ltd. has increased in size by 150%, more than doubling up to $500m in size. This makes it one of the largest single tranches of cat bond notes issued.The pricing on the transaction has dropped during marketing, with the expected range now 8.5% to 9%.Update 2: The pricing on the Tar Heel Re Ltd. catastrophe bond eventually dropped to the bottom of the revised range and the transaction priced with a coupon of 8.5%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The notes are exposed to hurricanes across the main U.S. hurricane exposed States and earthquakes including fire following across the entire U.S. mainland. The cover that this cat bond provides is on a per-occurrence basis and the structure uses an indemnity trigger.The term of this deal will be four years, one longer than its recent cat bond, which should enable Nationwide to lock-in currently attractive pricing for a longer duration.This 2013-2 tranche of notes is said to be pitched with an attachment point of $1.5 billion and the exhaustion point is set where the 2013-1 notes take over at $1.9 billion, covering a pro-rata amount of losses between those points.We’re told the Caelus Re 2013-2 notes have an initial attachment probability of 1.93% and an expected loss of 1.59%, while the recent 2013-1 cat bond saw a 1.28% attachment probability and 1.15% expected loss.The 2013-2 notes are being marketed with a coupon range of 6.25% to 7.25%.Update: This transaction increased in size to an offering of $320m of notes before close.The pricing finished around the middle ground at 6.85%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The cat bond will offer protection for earthquake risks in the following States; Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin, the same States as were covered by soon to mature Merna Reinsurance II Ltd. Given the list of covered States for this cat bond it’s clear that State Farm is seeking protection for New Madrid and surrounding areas earthquake risks.Merna Re IV is structured to provide protection on a per-occurrence basis to State Farm and it will use an indemnity trigger based on the ultimate net losses of the sponsor. The transaction is due to have a three-year deal term, beginning at the start of April 2013 and running through until May 2016.For losses to qualify they have to be caused by an earthquake which is USGS designated and the epicentre does not have to be within the covered area, rather the qualifying losses have to be within the covered States.The attachment point for Merna Re IV is set at $450m of ultimate net loss to State Farm and it will cover a pro-rata share of losses, after a 10% retention by the sponsor, up to $1.45 billion. Merna Re IV’s initial probability of attachment is said to be 0.55% while the expected loss figure is 0.40%.Pricing expectations suggest a coupon somewhere around the 2.75% mark above the return of the collateral investments.

The transaction will provide Citizens with a source of collateralized reinsurance capacity for hurricanes on a per-occurrence basis using an indemnity trigger over a three year risk period.The transaction will see Everglades Re Ltd., a Bermudian special purpose insurer, enter into a reinsurance agreement with Citizens, which it will collateralize through the sale of catastrophe bond notes in this Series 2013-1 issuance.We’re told by sources that the transaction has an initial size of $250m and that it covers Florida hurricane risks from within the Citizens coastal account segment, the same segment of its insurance program as last years Everglades Re 2012 cat bond provided reinsurance for. The transaction covers both personal residential and commercial residential business within Citizens Coastal Account.This second Everglades Re cat bond covers a slightly higher risk tranche of Citizens coastal account than the first deal and as such has a slightly higher probability of attachment.The initial attachment point for Everglades Re 2013 is just $5.139 billion of indemnity losses to Citizens and the initial exhaustion point is $5.389 billion, hence the $250m size of this deal. The attachment point is a good deal lower than last years Everglades Re 2012 transaction, which attached at $6.35 billion, so this 2013 issuance is more risky. This means that this new 2013 cat bond layer would attach before last years cat bond were a major hurricane to impact Florida and create losses above the indemnity attachment point.The initial attachment probability for these cat bond notes is 2.91%, the initial exhaustion probability is 2.73% and the initial expected loss is 2.80%. The notes will be subject to two annual resets at the end of each year risk period, during the three-year term. At each reset the attachment point will be kept within a range between 3.00% and 2.75%.As you can see from the image below, this 2013 cat bond comes into play before last years 2012 deal, attaching at a lower level in the stack. It also shows that before the Everglades 2013-1 cat bond faces a loss, Citizens has to exhaust its Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund coverage and much of its private reinsurance protection.A historical event loss analysis was undertaken by risk modeller for the transaction AIR Worldwide. The analysis found that three events since 1900, the no-name storm of 1926 that made landfall in Florida, 1992′s Hurricane Andrew, and the no-name storm of 1947 that made landfall in Florida and Louisiana, would have resulted in a loss to note holders. The first two events would have resulted in a full loss of principal on the notes, and the third event a 93% loss of principal to investors. Other events would have caused indemnity losses to Citizens but would not have reached the attachment point of $5.139 billion.The collateral from the sale of the cat bond notes is being invested in U.S. Treasury money-market funds and held within reinsurance trust accounts.The Everglades Re 2013 cat bond is being marketed with a much lower coupon than last years cat bond. Last years Everglades Re cat bond priced at 17.75% but we understand that this years is marketing with a range of 11% – 12%.Standard & Poor’s have assigned the single tranche of Everglades Re Series 2013-1 cat bond notes a preliminary rating of ‘B’.Update: Everglades Re 2013-1 priced at a reduced coupon of just 10%. Citizens said that this equates to an all-in cost to the insurer of about 11.5%. This represents a significant saving to the insurer and for this riskier tranche of notes than last years Everglades cat bond a reduction of 7.75% in coupon payment.Update: Citizens has hailed a cost-saving of as much as 40% from its latest transaction. It believes it may save as much as $60m over the lifetime of the transaction.“This transaction both lowered Citizens’ retention from last year and was completed at a cost savings of approximately 40 percent,” said CFO Sharon Binnun. “We were also able to accomplish this while increasing the term of the coverage to three years.”Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

It followed on that deals maturity with Caelus Re II Ltd., which was $185m in size covering the same perils.This cat bond is being issued by a recently established Cayman Islands domiciled SPV called Caelus Re 2013 Limited which was licensed as an insurer on the 5th February. Caelus Re 2013 Ltd. will seek to issue a single tranche of Series 2013-1 notes which at a preliminary size will look for around $200m of cover.The transaction will provide Nationwide Mutual with a fully-collateralized source of reinsurance on an indemnity and per-occurrence basis for two perils, U.S. hurricanes and U.S. earthquakes (including fire-following and sprinkler leakage).The indemnity trigger is based on the ultimate net loss of Nationwide Mutual and a number of subsidiaries. Details of the transaction name Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. and Nationwide Insurance Co. of FL as both cedents but we believe it covers a number of their subsidiaries too.The notes have an initial attachment point of $1.90 billion and an initial exhaustion point of $2.20 billion. The actual amount of losses from any event will be based on the paid losses and loss reserves of Nationwide, as adjusted by certain specified factors. S&P said that it expects Nationwide to retain at least a 10% share of the ultimate net loss from any qualifying catastrophe event.The deal runs for 2.75 years, with the first risk period set to begin on 1st June 2013 and the deal runs until 29th February 2016. Each risk period will run until 31st May and there will be a reset at that point.Hurricane cover will be in 29 hurricane exposed states of the U.S. (Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia, and the District of Columbia) while earthquake is for 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Reporting agencies for each peril are the U.S. National Hurricane Centre and the U.S. Geological Survey.Historical events have been modelled and risk modeller for the deal AIR Worldwide found that only the 1812 New Madrid quake would have caused a 100% loss of principal to the notes. No modelled historic hurricanes would have caused ultimate net losses which reached the attachment point.The initial probability of attachment for the notes is 1.28%, the initial probability of exhaustion is 1.04% and the expected loss is 1.15%. North Carolina, New York, Virgina, Texas and California are the five states which contribute the most to the expected loss by state as they are where the exposure is greatest.Looking at the modelling for this deal the hurricane cover is aimed to provide the greatest protection for Category 3 and 4 events, for earthquake it is magnitude 7.5 to 7.9 quakes which provide the greatest contribution to the expected loss.The deal is predominatly personal-lines coverage based, with some commercial lines business which are small to mid-range in size. Nationwide is actively reducing its hurricane exposure at this time.We’re told by investor sources that they expect the deal to price between 6.75% and 7.75% above the investment yield of U.S. money market funds which will be used for collateral purposes.Update:This cat bond increased in size by 35% to $270m during the marketing phase due to investor demand. The price guidance was reduced as well down to a range of 6% to 6.75%.Update 2:High demand pushed pricing down even further on this cat bond, resulting in a coupon of just 5.25% which leaves Nationwide Mutual with a very good value slice of cat bond cover.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

It again sees them looking for additional reinsurance cover to protect themsevles against a rise in medical benefit claims rates.Vitality Re IV Ltd. is a Cayman Islands domiciled exempted company licensed as a Class C insurer in the Cayman Islands established for the purpose of issuing ILS notes to cover the claims payments of Health Re Inc. and ultimately Aetna Life Insurance themselves relating to the covered medical benefit insurance business.The deal seeks to issue at least $150m of medical benefit claims linked ILS notes to investors in two tranches. The Class A tranche has a preliminary size of $105m while the Class B tranche has a size of $45m.Proceeds of the sale of the issued Vitality Re IV notes will be used to fund their obligations under excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements with Health Re Inc. and ultimately Aetna, providing a source of indemnity based on an annual aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance capacity against medical benefit claims above a predetermined threshold.Claims payments are covered above a medical benefit ratio (MBR) exceeding 102% for the Class A notes and 96% for the Class B notes. The MBR is calculated on an annual aggregate basis and reset annually using updated exposure data as well.The initial attachment points are calculated from the ceded premiums which are $750m. This works out at $765m for the Class A notes and $720m for the Class B notes (the 102% and 96% mentioned above respectively).The notes principal would be reduced on a sliding scale upwards along the MBR until the full $150 million of coverage would be paid to Aetna if the MBR reaches an initial exhaustion point of 102% for the Class B more risky notes and 116% for the Class A notes. Both attachment and exhaustion points will be reset annually for 2014, 2015 and 2016 to maintain modeled probabilities of attachment and expected loss on the Vitality Re IV notes equal to the initial modeled probabilities of attachment and expected loss.So the Class B tranche is the riskier of the two, with the lower attachment point, having an expected loss of 25bps, while the less risky Class A tranche has an expected loss of 1bp.Collateral assets from the sale of the notes will be invested in highly rated Treasury money market funds.Aetna said that the transaction allows it to reduce its required capital and it considers the Vitality Re series of ILS deals a key component of its long-term capital management strategy.“This reinsurance arrangement improves our capital efficiency and reduces our weighted average cost of capital,” said Aetna’s Treasurer Alfred P. Quirk, Jr. “Today’s transaction, which anticipates the end of our first Vitality Re arrangement in December 2013, marks the successful completion of our fourth such reinsurance arrangement.”Update:The transaction was significantly oversubscribed which enabled Aetna to get the pricing down on the deal making it more cost efficient over the term.The $105m Class A notes were originally marketed with a price guidance range of the collateral investment yield plus 350-425 bps. The Class A notes priced down at 275 bps (2.75%), a drop of 21% from the lower end of the original pricing range, or 35% from the upper.The $45m Class B notes saw a similarly large drop in pricing, having begun marketing with a range of 450-525 bps and pricing at 375 bps (3.75%), a drop of 16% from the lower end of the price guidance range or 28% from the upper.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Cover is for New Madrid earthquake and severe thunderstorm or tornado risks. A single tranche of Series 2013-1 notes are being issued.The transaction involves a single tranche of notes being privately placed with capital market investors to collateralize an underlying reinsurance policy for The Cincinnati Insurance Company. The deal covers a $100m layer of risk, with a pro-rata limit of $72m which has been collateralized by the $61.2m of notes issued by Skyline Re and the net premium.Cover is on an indemnity trigger basis but the trigger is designed to act like a top or drop excess layer of reinsurance cover. We understand the top coverage layer is for New Madrid quake in specific states while the severe thunderstorm is the drop coverage layer and is on a county basis. The way this is structured suggests that tornado and severe thunderstorm makes up most of the risk associated with the deal.Severe thunderstorm, which includes tornado losses, is on an aggregate basis and applies to the 75 counties with Cincinnati’s highest amount of total insured property values. As we understand it the earthquake coverage is not county limited, rather it applies to any quakes on the New Madrid fault zone causing Cincinnati losses in pre-defined States.For severe thunderstorm risks, loss recovery under the terms of the reinsurance treaty begins when all events in aggregate exceed $125m of storm losses, after a $5m deductible per event.For New Madrid earthquake risks, which provides protection on a per-occurrence basis, insured losses have to exceed $600m before any loss to the Skyline Re cat bond would occur.The deal has a one year risk period.The transaction upsized to $61.2m at close due to demand from investors and the sponsor, Cincinnati Insurance Companies desire to support that demand. TWCM told us that the deal was upsized as far as the sponsors budget would allow.On the pricing of the transaction, Rick Miller from TWCM said that; “Relative to the reinsurance limit, the deal priced at a net rate-on-line of 15%.”Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

That deal matures at the end of 2012 and Lakeside Re III is scheduled to complete at the renewals and run for three full years providing a three-year source of earthquake reinsurance in the U.S. and Canada.Cover is on an indemnity trigger and annual aggregate basis, triggered by the cedents aggregate ultimate net losses. As well as earthquake cover this cat bond also covers various types of damage which could follow an earthquake or ground-shaking, including fire following, sprinkler leakage, volcanic disturbance or eruption, tsunami and flooding caused by dam or levy breaches.Lakeside Re III broadens the scope of the cat bond coverage to provide reinsurance cover for earthquakes in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island and Quebec as well as the U.S. states of California, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, Oregon and Washington. The U.S. states covered means that Zurich is including its New Madrid fault risks in this deal along with Californian and Pacific Northwest quake risks.Under the terms of the underlying reinsurance contract Zurich maintains a retained share of at least 10% of the aggregated ultimate net losses for each annual risk period.For an earthquake to become a covered event it must meet certain parameters, it must be reported by the USGS and it must cause ground-shaking in the covered area of intensity level VI or more (a measurement from the USGS Shakemap). For an event to qualify under the terms of the reinsurance contract the ultimate net loss to Zurich must be at least $35m, the franchise deductible level. If the deal completes at $225m the notes will cover 75% of losses from the attachment point of $650m up to the exhaustion point of $950m, with Zurich required to retain at least 10% of losses. The covered business is largely commercial but may include some personal risk.According to Munich Re the Aggregate Ultimate Net Loss for each annual risk period is determined by:
− The aggregate of the Ultimate Net Loss for each Loss Occurrence
− To be included, the Ultimate Net Loss from a Loss Occurrence must be equal to or greater than the Franchise Deductible
− If such Ultimate Net Loss equals or exceeds the Franchise Deductible, then the entire amount of the Ultimate Net Loss is includedCalifornia contributes 62.9% of the expected loss of the cat bond, New Madrid is 12.6%, Pacific Northwest is 8.6%, Eastern Canada 4.8% and Western Canada 11.3%. Los Angeles and Vancouver contain the highest exposure by city.The attachment probability for the notes is 2.9%, the expected loss is 2.09% and the exhaustion probability is 1.49%. The annualised expected loss is 2.04%. The notes will be reset annually based on the latest exposure data provided.Based on remodelling of historical events by risk modeller RMS no historical events since 1906 would have reached the attachment point for this deal. Five years between 1663 and 1906 would have seen the cat bond attach and some principal reduction occur. 1732 (Montreal/19% principal reduction), 1811 (New Madrid/100% principal reduction), 1812 (two events in the New Madrid region/100% principal reduction), 1868 (Hayward/68% principal reduction) and 1906 (San Francisco/100% principal reduction) are years that saw events that caused principal reductions.Collateral is being dealt with using collateral account but the deposits will be initially invested in the MEAG Lakeside Re III fund which has been established for this cat bond by Munich Re’s investment subsidiary.Lakeside Re III is a Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurer. The single tranche of notes it is issuing have received a preliminary rating from Standard & Poor’s of ‘B+’.Price guidance for the notes is 8.0% to 9.0%.Update:Before close, Lakeside Re III upsized this issuance by $45m to close at $270m of cover.S&P affirmed the single tranche of notes rating at ‘B+’.The $270m of notes were listed on the Bermuda Stock Exchange.The notes priced at the lower end of the expected range at 8.0% above Treasury Money Market Funds.Update 13th Feb 2014:The attachment point for this cat bond has been lifted to $696m at the annual reset, with Zurich citing an increased exposure.Due to the increased exposure in its insurance book and the need to maintain the expected loss of the cat bond layer, the attachment point was lifted to $696m and exhaustion for the layer it covers as well.Update 16th Feb 2015:Zurich has again listed the attachment point for its $270m Lakeside Re III catastrophe bond at the January 1st annual reset.The attachment point has been lifted further to $777m for the layer of cover that Lakeside Re III provides cover for, as Zurich adjusted its reinsurance program, lifting retentions in some areas.The change is based on updated exposure data and a stated reinsurance report, and so while maintaining the expected loss of the reinsurance layer provided by the cat bond at 2.04%, the attachment point of the cover from Lakeside Re III has been lifted to $777m. As a result the exhaustion point has increased as well to $1.077 billion.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The trigger for the Class A tranche of notes will be an industry loss index from PCS which will be county weighted.The Class B tranche of notes has a preliminary size of €50m and provides cover for European windstorms on a per-occurrence basis. The trigger for the Class B tranche of notes will use a PERILS industry loss index which will be Cresta zone weighted.The transaction will not come on-risk until the 1st January 2013 with the risk period expected to run from then until the end of 2015, so providing SCOR with a three year source of cover on both aggregate and per-occurrence basis’.The Class A notes provide hurricane cover for all the eastern (including Florida) and gulf coast exposed states as well as Puerto Rico. Earthquake cover is for all 48 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The notes have an index attachment point of 685 and an index exhaustion point of 785. These notes are annual aggregate in nature, meaning that they cover frequency events as well as single large events. So a number of qualifying hurricanes and earthquakes could contribute to the index value over the course of each of the three year risk periods. The index values will be reset at the end of each annual risk period. For a hurricane or earthquake catastrophe event to qualify it must have a PCS catastrophe number assigned. For hurricane events it could actually be a tropical storm that is severe enough to require a PCS catastrophe number. The Class A notes have an attachment probability of 2.09%, an expected loss of 1.86% and an exhaustion probability of 1.64%.The Class B notes provide European windstorm cover for Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden. The index attachment point for these notes is 575, while the index exhaustion point is 675. These notes afford cover on a per-occurrence basis, meaning that they can only be triggered by a single storm meeting the industry loss index trigger point and which is severe enough to generate a PERILS industry loss report. The Class B notes have an attachment probability of 1.75%, an expected loss of 1.50% and an exhaustion probability of 1.30%.Collateral will be invested in EBRD notes, dollar denominated for the Class A tranche and Euro denominated for the Class B tranche.Price guidance shows that the Class A tranche is expected to price somewhere between 8.25% and 9.00% while the Class B notes show a range of 3.65% to 4.15%.Update:Atlas Reinsurance VII increased in size before close. The Class A tranche grew to $50m-$60m and the Class B tranche more than doubled to €120m-€130m, bringing the total deal size to around $228m.Pricing dropped on both tranches of notes. The Class A tranche was marketed with a coupon of between 8.25% and 9.00% but it is expected to price at or below the bottom of that range between 8.00% and 8.25%. The Class B tranche was marketed with a coupon between 3.65% to 4.15% and is now expected to price at the bottom end of that range at 3.65%.Update 2:At pricing SCOR achieved the upper size for the deal and the lower end of pricing.The Class A (hurricane/earthquake) tranche finished at the upper end at $60m. The Class B European windstorm tranche finished at the upper end again at €130m.The Class A notes priced at the bottom end at 8.00%. The Class B notes priced at the 3.65% mark.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Mortality index.","S&P: Class A - 'B+', Class C - 'B-'","Nov 2012","The second cat bond from reinsurer Swiss Re to carry the Mythen name, so named after their head-office location on Mythenquai in Zurich, after they successfully issued Mythen Ltd. in May.This new cat bond is called Mythen Re Ltd. (Series 2012-2) and marks a first for the cat bond market as it seeks to issue notes which cover both a catastrophe peril (hurricane) and mortality risk within a single tranche of notes.Mythen Re Ltd. is a Cayman Islands special purpose insurer established to issue variable rate notes and this 2012-2 series of notes will be its first series of notes offered under the program. The transaction involves three tranches, all of which are unsized at this time, although we’re told by sources that the deal will target at least $75m and our sources said it will likely grow beyond that. The deal is designed to provide Swiss Re with a source of fully-collateralized reinsurance cover for the covered perils for a four year period until late 2016. In this deal, the Class A tranche of notes is the really interesting one as it combines both U.S. Atlantic hurricane risk with UK extreme mortality risk in a single class of notes, each with their own distinct triggers. The Class B and C tranches are just exposed to U.S. hurricanes.This is the first time that a cat bond deal has ever combined hurricane risk and mortality risk into a single tranche of notes.The Class A tranche of notes can be triggered by either a U.S. hurricane event, as measured by a PCS industry loss index or by an extreme mortality event in the UK resulting in a mortality index trigger level above 125%, as calculated by RMS.The covered area is much of the hurricane exposed U.S. East and Gulf coasts, including Florida and also Puerto Rico and for the mortality risk we’re told just England and Wales (not Scotland).The hurricane industry loss attachment probability for the Class A tranche of notes is 2.16%, the expected loss is 1.7% and the exhaustion probability is 1.4%. For the UK mortality risk the attachment probability is 0.36%, the expected loss is 0.31% and the exhaustion probability is 0.2%. From those numbers it’s clear that the extreme mortality trigger is a much more remote event and so this tranche of notes exposure to hurricanes is the more risky component (according to the modelling). You can add up those probabilities to get a combined view of the tranche however given that the triggers for the two risks are not integrated and the mortality risk is much more remote it wouldn’t be a true combined probability of attachment for this tranche.The Class B and Class C tranches of notes are both exposed to U.S. hurricane risks on an industry-loss basis and will use a PCS industry loss trigger. Both tranches cover the same region as the Class A tranche but for different industry-loss levels. The Class B tranche of notes has an attachment probability of 3.11%, an expected loss of 2.58% and an exhaustion probability of 2.17%, which makes this tranche riskier than Class A. The Class C tranche of notes has an attachment probability of 4.73%, an expected loss of 3.78% and an exhaustion probability of 3.09%, making this the riskiest tranche of the deal.The mortality risk component of the deal attaches at an index level of 125% and exhausts at an index level of 135%. All of the hurricane exposure uses a PCS industry loss index trigger. The Class A hurricane risk attaches at an index value of 620.2 and exhausts at 845.5. The Class B hurricane risk exposed layer attaches at 513.5 and exhausts at 624.8. The riskier Class C tranche attaches at an index value of 372.7 and exhausts at 511.4.PCS industry loss data is being used for the hurricane trigger. For the mortality trigger, actual mortality data will be input into the calculation model by RMS to derive a mortality index value which would identify whether the deal has triggered or not.Collateral for the transaction is being invested in International Bank for Reconstruction and Development notes.The guidance pricing for each tranche in this cat bond is as follows. All percentages are above the collateral investment yield percentage rate:
Class A: 9.00% – 9.50%
Class B: 8.75% – 9.75%
Class C: 11.75% – 12.75%Update (24th October 2012):The Class B tranche of notes has been withdrawn from this offering. We’re unsure exactly why but sources suggest it may not have had enough interest to make it economical to issue. The Class A hurricane/mortality and Class C riskier hurricane tranches both still remain.The transaction is targeting $200m, with the Class A tranche sized at $120m and the Class C sized at $80m.Pricing has dropped to the lower end of the range yet again. The Class A tranche is now expected to price at between 8.50% and 9.00%, while the Class C tranche is expected to price at 11.75%. Once again this demonstrates the appetite in the market right now.Update 2:Mythen Re Ltd. priced on the 25th October, remaining at $200m in size.

MultiCat Mexico 2009 was also Cayman Islands domiciled, but this is a new exempted company set up for this deal and potentially to issue future series of notes if required. Swiss Re, as ceding reinsurer, are responsible for any payments due under the retrocession contract between it and MultiCat Mexico.The deal has a preliminary size of $300m and will feature three classes of notes. $140m of Class A notes which will provide protection from earthquakes, $60m of Class B notes which provide protection against Atlantic coast of Mexico hurricanes and $100m of Class C notes which provide protection against Pacific coast of Mexico hurricanes. All three classes of notes afford protection on a per-occurrence basis. The cat bond transaction is designed to provide retrocessional cover to Swiss Re, but given the underlying reinsurance the deal ultimately benefits FONDEN. The transaction will provide coverage for an expected term of just over 3 years, with maturity slated to be the 4th December 2015.As in the MultiCat Mexico 2009 cat bond the deal features three parametric triggers, one for each class of notes.For the $140m earthquake exposed Class A notes, there are five earthquake zones where the epicentre of a qualifying earthquake must be and both the magnitude and depth of any earthquakes will also be used in the parametric trigger. The coverage area is larger than in the 2009 transaction, which only had three earthquake zones, with two new zones in the north of Mexico. You can see the factors which will denote a trigger event and the five earthquake zones for the Class A notes below (taken from the S&P presale documentation). The parametric trigger for earthquake is much more detailed than in the 2009 transaction, where earthquake depth was the same for each zone, although the magnitude parameters did differ.For the $60m Class B tranche of notes, which are the first hurricane exposed tranche and exposed only to hurricanes which impact the Atlantic coast of Mexico, there are two hurricane zones where the central pressure of a hurricane must be below a pre-defined level for a hurricane to qualify as a covered event. Again this is a different structure to the 2009 Multicat cat bond as that had three hurricane tranches of notes, each of which only had one hurricane zone, the 2012 transaction is a much more detailed structure. You can see the central pressure factors which will denote a trigger event and the two hurricane zones for the Class B notes below (taken from the S&P presale documentation).Finally, the $100m of Class C notes, which are also exposed to hurricanes, features one large hurricane zone running down the Pacific coast of Mexico, but has two parameters for the central pressure of hurricanes. This tranche of notes can payout on less severe hurricanes with a higher minimum central pressure as they have a parameter which will allow for a 50% payout of principal. For more severe qualifying hurricanes a 100% payout of principal would occur. Again, this offers much broader protection for the sponsors than the previous MultiCat Mexico 2009 deal afforded. The MultiCat Mexico 2012 cat bond is a much better structure, offering broader protection to the reinsured and ultimately insured parties, but also making the transaction a slightly higher risk investment, which will likely be reflected in the coupon payments. You can see the central pressure factors which will denote both the 50% and 100% trigger event and the single hurricane zone for the Class C notes below (taken from the S&P presale documentation).This deal is a little more risky than the 2009 MultiCat, but only because the cover has been extended and the triggers tailored to a much greater degree. The Class A notes have a probability of attachment of 4.40% and the Class B notes have a probability of attachment of 2.73%. As the Class A and B tranche would be a total loss if any qualifying event occurs their expected losses and probability of exhaustion figures are the same. The Class C notes are slightly different as they can either payout 50% or 100% of the principal depending on the minimum central pressure of a hurricane which passes through the hurricane zone and so they have a probability of attachment of 5.69%, an expected loss of 4.36% and a probability of exhaustion of 3.02%.For the class A notes, S&P says that there have been six earthquakes since 1787 that would have reached the attachment index point. For the class B notes there have been four historical hurricanes with a central pressure that would have met the conditions for attachment, and S&P notes that these are all events in recent times since 1977. For the class C notes there have been two hurricanes between 1949 and 2004 with a central pressure that would have reached the attachment index point and both would only have resulted in 50% principal loss to the notes investors.The Class A, earthquake exposed notes, are expected to pay investors a coupon of 8.75% to 9.00% above Treasury Money Market Funds. The Class B, Atlantic coast hurricane notes, are expected to pay 9.00% to 9.50%. The Class C, Pacific coast hurricane exposed notes, are expected to pay a coupon of 8.75% to 9.10%.Standard & Poor’s has assigned its ‘B (sf)’, ‘B+ (sf)’, and ‘B- (sf)’ preliminary ratings to the Series 2012-1 class A, B, and C notes respectively which are being issued by MultiCat Mexico Ltd. in this cat bond transaction.You can also view the details of the MultiCat Mexico 2009 transaction.Update:The transaction upsized a little, with the Class B tranche of notes growing from $60m to $75m, taking the total transaction size to $315m before close.Price guidance dropped quite dramatically during the marketing phase. You can see the reduction in the table below:Class A: Was 8.75% – 9.00%, Now 8.00% – 8.50%Class B: Was 9.00% – 9.50%, Now 7.75% – 8.50%Class C: Was 8.75% – 9.10%, Now 7.50% – 8.25%Update 2:The transaction closed and the variable rate note program and issued notes were listed on the Cayman Islands Stock Exchange.Rating agency Standard & Poor’s affirmed the deals ratings as ‘B (sf)’, ‘B+ (sf)’, and ‘B- (sf)’ preliminary ratings to the Series 2012-1 class A, B, and C notes respectively.The final pricing was at the bottom of the revised guidance range, indicating the demand in the market yet again enabling a sponsor to acquire cover at a lower than expected price.The $140m of Class A notes which are exposed to earthquakes priced at 8.00%, the upsized $75m of Class B notes which are exposed to Atlantic hurricanes priced at 7.75% and the $100m of Class C notes which are exposed to Pacific hurricanes priced at 7.50%.Update on Hurricane Odile:On 15th September 2014 Hurricane Odile made landfall near Cabo San Lucas in Mexico, an area where the class C notes cover hurricane losses. The data on Odile’s landfall made it look as if the Class C tranche of notes would be triggered.An event report was submitted and the Class C notes were placed on a rating watch by S&P on the 18th September.On the 19th of December the National Hurricane Center, the reporting agency, published its cyclone report for Hurricane Odile.This report featured the data required for the calculation agent AIR Worldwide to establish whether Hurricane Odile had breached the parametric trigger causing a loss to the Class C notes or not.The data from the NHC had changed sufficiently since the initial landfall, due to extra analysis and data collection, to raise the minimum central pressure sufficiently to put the notes out of harms way.On the 23rd December 2014 AIR Worldwide published its final event report, confirming that it had determined that hurricane Odile was not a triggering event meaning that investors did not face a loss.More details can be found in our articles covering this event.– 15th September, Did hurricane Odile just trigger the MultiCat Mexico 2012 cat bond?– 18th September, MultiCat Mexico 2012 cat bond payout not guaranteed yet.– 19th September, Fate of MultiCat Mexico 2012 should be known within 120 days: S&P.– 22nd December, MultiCat Mexico 2012 cat bond may not trigger, hurricane Odile data shows.– 29th December, No Odile loss for MultiCat Mexico 2012 catastrophe bond.– 31st December, S&P affirms MultiCat Mexico cat bond as Odile not a triggering event.Update on Hurricane Patricia, October 2015:Hurricane Patricia has become the most powerful storm in the region on record. A massive pressure drop down to 880mb, with sustained winds of 200mph as the hurricane approaches land put the Class C notes of MultiCat Mexico 2012 on watch.As the storm neared there seems little chance it will weaken enough to spare the notes, making a loss increasingly likely.The latest: Hurricane Patricia intensifies further, MultiCat cat bond risk rising.Update on Hurricane Patricia, February 2016Finally a determination was made that the $100m Class C tranche of notes would face a 50% loss of principal. This took a considerable length of time as the National Hurricane Center’s final tropical cyclone report and best track data was not released until the 4th February 2016.Calculation agent AIR Worldwide then published its final report, revealing a $50m event payment determination meaning investors in this Class C tranche faced a 50% loss of principal to their investments.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Series 2012-1 will provide protection to three named entities of the Hannover Re group; Hannover Rückversicherung AG, E+S Rückversicherung AG and Hannover Re (Bermuda) Ltd.Eurus III will replace the cover aforded by Eurus II which matured in April of this year.The risk period runs from the end of September 2012 to the end of March 2016, thus providing Hannover Re with a source of cover for four windstorm seasons in Europe. Protection will be afforded on a per occurrence basis over the risk period and the transaction will utilise an industry loss trigger based on a PERILS index of loss estimates.The transaction will provide windstorm cover in; Belgium, Denmark, France and Corsica, Germany, Republic of Ireland, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden and the UK. The PERILS industry loss index will be resolved down to Cresta zone level for all countries except for Norway where it will be resolved by county.The transaction covers any qualifying windstorm event occurring during the risk period. The industry loss trigger is on a per occurrence basis and the notes have an initial index attachment point of 161 and exhaustion point of 236. The attachment probability is said to be 2% in the first year and the expected loss is said to be 1.42%. The notes will cover losses between the windstorm index value attachment point of 161 and the windstorm index value exhaustion point of 236. The index value is calculated on a per-occurrence basis.A single tranche of Series 2012-1 Class A notes will be issued by Eurus III Ltd. The deal has an initial size of €75m but will be upsized if the appetite in the market is sufficient and the cover can be written at a reasonable cost to Hannover Re.The notes sold through this transaction will collateralize the underlying reinsurance agreements with each of the Hannover Re subsidiaries for the cover. Collateral from the proceeds of the sale of the notes issued by Eurus III Ltd. will be invested in European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) notes.We’re told by sources that the transaction is being marketed with an expected coupon range of 4%-4.5%.Update:Eurus III increased in size during the marketing phase from €75m to €100m (US$126m).We’re told that Eurus III will price below the expected range that it was originally marketed at, helped by demand. The deal is now expected to price at between 3.75% and 4%, compared to an initial pricing expectation that was for a range of 4% to 4.5%.The deal finally priced at 3.75% as pricing slipped below the expected range helped by high demand before the deal closed.A spokeswoman told us that with Eurus III Hannover Re pursues its strategy to use, besides the traditional reinsurance markets, also the capital markets to transfer catastrophe risks.“The transaction enhances the diversification of our retrocession program”, the spokeswoman told us. “Eurus III also strengthens our risk management and protects our capital against severe windstorm events in various European countries over the next four storm seasons.”The spokeswoman also told us that the cat bond had been placed with institutional investors in both Europe and North America.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

(Series 2012-2), will see the Bermuda domiciled transformer offer investors a single tranche of Class A notes which are designed to provide the CEA with a source of multi-year risk transfer via a reinsurance agreement giving protection on an annual aggregate basis for a three-year risk period against property losses from earthquakes in the covered area. The funds from the sale of the notes are used to collateralize a reinsurance agreement between Embarcadero Re and the CEA. As with the other Embarcadero Re deals the trigger will be an indemnity trigger based on the CEA’s UNL.We understand that the CEA is hoping for $150m of cover from this transaction.The cover afforded by this 2012-2 issuance by Embarcadero Re will be for residential properties that are insured by the CEA and includes some renters, no commercial properties are covered by this deal. The transaction has an attchment point for the first loss occurrence period of $6.233 billion and an exhaustion point of $6.533 billion. The high attachment point makes this deal less risky than the other two Embarcadero Re deals, the Series 2011-1 deal attached at $3.287 billion of losses and the Series 2012-1 deal attached at $2.91 billion. So this latest cat bond from the CEA will provide a layer of reinsurance protection much higher up their overall program of protection.Looking at historical events, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake would have caused a 100% loss of principal and the 1994 Northridge earthquake would have caused a 27.2% loss of principal.The transaction is subject to an annual reset where attachment probabilities will be reset where it will be kept constant unless there are some qualifying losses which cause a dropdown event and eroded retention level on the transaction. This deal has an attachment probability in the first year of 0.77%.Collateral from the sale of the notes will be invested in U.S. Treasury money market funds.We’re told by contacts that this transaction is marketing with an expected coupon range of 4.5% to 5.25% above Treasuries, an coupon rate which reflects the lower risk nature of this transaction compared to the other Embarcadero Re deals.Update: We’re told by sources, that Embarcadero Re Ltd. (Series 2012-2) will close at $300m in a single deal, having doubled in size from the $150m it began marketing at. This means that the CEA will have used up the total $300m mandate they had approved for use in cat bonds during 2012 and cat bonds will, when this deal completes, comprise somewhere around 20% of their overall risk transfer program.We’re told that when the deal prices it will pay a coupon of Treasury Money Market Funds plus 5%.

"Vita Capital V Ltd.","Vita Capital V Ltd.","Swiss Re","Swiss Re Capital Markets are sole arranger","RMS are risk modeller and calculation agent","Extreme mortality","$275m","Mortality index","S&P: Class D-1 - 'BBB-', Class E-1 - 'BB+'","Jul 2012","Swiss Re are bringing their latest Vita Capital mortality-linked catastrophe bond market, their fifth such transaction, which is being issued through a Cayman Islands entity Vita Capital V Ltd. which will issue two tranches of mortality-linked notes.This Series 2012-1 issuance, Vita Capital V Ltd. will issue two tranches of mortality-linked cat bond notes. The aim of the transaction, is to secure a fully-collateralized source of multi-year extreme mortality protection via risk transfer with the capital markets, for the sponsor Swiss Re.The notes issued by Vita Capital V Ltd. will provide Swiss Re with cover via an ISDA-based contract and protection is afforded on an aggregate basis over a five year risk period against excess mortality in certain specified countries. A Class D-1 tranche of notes covers excess mortality in Australia and Canada while a Class E-1 notes cover excess mortality in Australia, Canada and the U.S.Both tranches are being marketed as at least $50m in size we are told, but it’s likely that Vita Capital V will be larger than $100m by close if Swiss Re choose to take advantage of inevitable demand for mortality risk in this form. For each class of notes, Swiss Re and Vita Capital V have entered into an ISDA-based counterparty contract under which the counterparty (which is Swiss Re) will make payments in exchange for extreme mortality protection (provided by Vita Capital V) for a specified notional amount.Investors in the notes issued by Vita Capital V will be at risk of an increase in age and gender weighted mortality rates that exceed a specified percentage of a predefined mortality index value for the term of the deal. Interestingly, the five year risk-period is slightly retrospective and the first risk period began on the 1st January 2012, meaning that mortality data from the first half of this year is included in the deals calculation.The trigger is based on a mortality index and there are predefined points on the index where the notes can be triggered and hence suffer a loss of principal. For the Class D-1 notes to be triggered and any loss of principal to occur, the Australia reference mortality index would need to increase by at least 35% or the Canada reference mortality index would need to increase by at least 20% over any two consecutive-year measurement period between 1st January 2012, and 31st December 2016. For the Class E-1 tranche of notes, one of the reference mortality indices would have to increase by at least 20% for Australia, 10% for Canada, and 5% for the U.S. over the same measurement period. The mortality index value (MIV) is defined on a rolling two-year period and so the likelihood of a loss occurring or the amount of any loss depends on the extent to which the mortality index value exceeds the attachment point for the notes.Mortality catastrophe bonds such as Vita Capital V are exposed to large increases in mortality rates and so events such as pandemics, influenza outbreaks, tsunamis, earthquakes, major natural catastrophe events, terrorist attacks, disease epidemics or an unmodeled event could impact the deal. However these are remote risks and as such transactions such as this generally have lower probability of attachments than many natural catastrophe bonds.Collateral from the sale of the notes will be invested in International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) notes. Interestingly this is the first deal where the collateral investment will pay a negative percentage below LIBOR back as we’re told that the IBRD notes will pay around 0.3% below LIBOR. That is due to the historically low interest rates in the wider financial markets caused by the economic crisis that is hitting certain regions and markets hard.Standard & Poor’s considers that an event such as another pandemic similar to the 1918 flu outbreak, a large event risk such as a full-scale ground war or tsunami, or several nuclear bombs exploding in large cities in Australia, Canada, or the U.S. could cause a loss for the noteholders. RMS’ risk analysis also concluded that a recurrence of the 1918 flu pandemic and World War I would have resulted in a 100% principal reduction to the Class E-1 tranche of notes, but only the 1918 flu pandemic would have resulted in a 100% principal reduction to the Class D-1 notes. In the past 100 years, events such as the peak of AIDS deaths in 1987 and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, would not have triggered any loss of principal under the terms of the notes. In S&P’s view, the biggest risks are a man-made catastrophe, such as a nuclear, chemical, or biological war/terrorist attack; a natural catastrophe; or a substantial pandemic. S&P has given the Class D-1 notes a preliminary rating of ‘BBB-‘ and the Class E-1 notes a preliminary rating of ‘BB+’.We’re told by sources that the Class D-1 notes have an attachment probability of 0.34% and will likely pay a coupon in the range of 2.7% to 3%, while the Class E-1 notes have an attachment probability of 0.8% and will likely pay a coupon in the region of 3.4% to 3.8%.Update: The transaction is now sized at $275m, a significant increase on the $100m it was first marketed at. We understand that the Class D-1 notes are $125m in size and the Class E-1 are $150m in size.The deal will price right at the lower end of the expected range, we’re told, with the Class D-1 notes paying a coupon of 2.7% and the Class E-1 notes paying a coupon of 3.4%.The deal completed successfully at $275m. S&P affirmed the ratings as above and the shelf programme and two tranches of notes were admitted for listing on the Cayman Islands Stock Exchange. Pricing remains unchanged, having priced right at the lower end of expectations.Update March 2016As is typical with the Vita Capital series of mortality catastrophe bonds, Swiss Re issued an early redemption notice for this Vita Capital V deal. The redemption payment date would be April 15th 2016.Investors in the notes will be paid a 1% premium for the early redemption, so effectively receiving 101 cents per dollar investment.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Queen Street Re VI Ltd., a Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurer, has been formed to issue catastrophe bond notes designed to provide Munich Re with a source of fully-collateralized retrocession reinsurance coverage providing protection on a per-occurrence basis for U.S. hurricane risks from 1st August 2012 to 31st March 2015 and European windstorm risks from October 2012 and 31st March 2015.For a hurricane event to be covered under the terms of the deal they must have a PCS catastrophe number and impact somewhere in the defined covered areas of the U.S. states of Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. With this deal Munich Re are seeking broad hurricane coverage along the entire length of U.S. coastline that has exposure to this peril.For a European windstorm event to qualify as a covered event it must be a large enough storm to be identified by PERILS and impact somewhere in the covered area of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K.The notes cover losses between the hurricane index value attachment point of 84,000 and the hurricane index value exhaustion point of 130,000, and losses between the European windstorm index value attachment point of 13,000 and the European windstorm index value exhaustion point of 17,500. Both index values are calculated on a per-occurrence basis.AIR Worldwide will calculate an index value after being notified of a qualifying event. The index value for U.S. hurricane risks will be based on industry losses reported by PCS by state and line of business, which AIR will disaggregate to county using its modeled industry loss allocation and predetermined payout factors by county and line of business. The index value for the European windstorm risk will be based on industry losses reported by PERILS AG and predetermined payout factors by CRESTA zone, including constant exchange rates for Denmark, the U.K., Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.The deal features an annual reset to allow Munich Re to reset payout factors and there are limitations for certain covered areas as to how much they can contribute to expected losses so as to prevent the deals risk becoming weighted to one region, for example Florida.The overall initial attachment probability for the transaction is 3.87%, the expected loss is 2.71% and the exhaustion probability is 1.84%. Fir U.S. hurricane the attachment probability is 1.8%, the expected loss is 1.23% and the exhaustion probability is 0.75%. For European windstorm the attachment probability is 2.09%, the expected loss is 1.48% and the exhaustion probability is 1.09%.Only one historic hurricane event would have reached the index attachment point. The 1926 NoName6 hurricane which impacted Florida and Alabama would have caused a loss to noteholders of approximately 37% of the notional balance of the notes. There have been no historic European windstorm events which would have breached the index attachment point.Collateral will be deposited in a collateral account and then transferred to a specially established Treasury money market fund, MEAG Queen Street VI fund. Standard & Poor’s gave the MEAG Queen Street VI fund a ‘AAAm’ rating.Standard & Poor’s have given the single tranche of notes to be issued by Queen Street VI Re Ltd. a preliminary rating of ‘B’.Update: Queen Street VI Re Ltd. will likely secure $100m of cover for Munich Re. The latest news on pricing is that the transaction has priced below the expected range due to investor demand.The original forecast pricing range was 10.75% to 11.5%, but the deal has actually finalised at 10.35%.Munich Re say say that the cover from Queen Street VI provides them with protection for losses from extreme events with a combined statistical return period of around 35 years. Queen Street III, Queen Street IV and Queen Street V all were structured to provide cover for events with a combined return period of 50 years, so covering lower probability events than this latest deal.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

It will provide the unnamed Florida homeowner’s specialty insurer with a $22.78m source of fully collateralized, indemnity based catastrophe reinsurance cover via the capital markets.TWCM arranged for Oak Leaf Re 2012-1 to contain three layers of the cedant’s risk management program, including a reinstatement premium protection layer. That’s a broad coverage from a small cat bond and will have been attractive to the cedant as it will have allowed them to closely tie this to their wider reinsurance program. Similar to the 2011-1 deal, Oak Leaf Re 2012-1 also covered a layer that provided both top-layer and aggregate protection of the cedant’s program. TWCM say that this years deal also demonstrates that its private placement catastrophe bond offering has growing investor appeal, as Oak Leaf Re 2012-1 expanded the number of investors compared to its initial offering last year, with some investors participating in more than one layer.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The actual beneficiaries of the deal include the Travelers Indemnity Co., Travelers Casualty and Surety Co., St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co., and The Standard Fire Insurance Co., together with their direct and indirect insurance subsidiaries.The Class A notes will cover a percentage of losses between an attachment point of $2 billion and an exhaustion point of $2.5 billion of the ultimate net losses of Travelers in the covered region on a per-occurrence basis. Interestingly, there is a limit set for the maximum loss per risk, or building covered under the transaction, of $20m.Long Point Re III covers a majority subset of Travelers overall personal and commercial lines portfolio of business. The commercial lines business is a mix of Travelers’s select accounts (small business policies) and commercial accounts according to S&P. Certain business units that cover large and unique exposures, complex financial structures, and mobile property have been excluded from the subject business.The covered area for Long Point Re III is the northeastern U.S. coastal states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.AIR Worldwide are providing risk modelling services for the deal. In their historical modelling work they identified one historical event, the 1938 Northeast Clipper hurricane which impacted New York, which would have caused a total loss to the notes with losses of $2.711 billion. No other historical events would even have hit the attachment point.The probability of attachment for the notes is 0.89% with an expected loss of 0.81%, while the probability of exhaustion is 0.71%. Those are pretty low figures in the world of cat bonds so it’s expected that this deal will pay a relatively low coupon compared to other U.S. hurricane cat bonds, however the diversification it offers should still make it very attractive to investors looking for safer returns.Proceeds from the sale of the Long Point Re III notes will be deposited in a reinsurance trust account and invested into U.S. Treasury money market funds. The notes will pay a coupon somewhere in the range of 6.25% to 7% we are told.Update: This cat bond increased in size before close to $250m due to investor demand. The pricing guidance was lowered to between 6% and 6.25%.The transaction eventually priced at the lower end of that range at 6% on the 30th May.The deal completed successfully on the 6th June when Standard & Poor’s affirmed its ratings at ‘BB+’.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Each exposed tranche will be exposed to U.S. hurricane, U.S. earthquake, U.S. severe thunderstorm, U.S. winter storm and U.S. wildfire risks. The deal will provide USAA with a source of fully collateralized reinsurance cover on both per-occurrence and aggregate basis over a four year period. Indemnity triggers will be used for each tranche.A Class 3 tranche of notes is sized at $50m currently and will provide per-occurrence coverage for the five perils. The Class 3, per-occurrence notes will attach at $2 billion of losses.A Class 5 tranche of notes is currently sized at $100m and provides cover on an annual aggregate basis. The Class 5 annual aggregate notes attach at $1.571 billion of losses.A Class 7 tranche of notes has not been given a size yet and will also provide cover on an annual aggregate basis for all perils. The Class 7 annual aggregate notes attach at $900m. The Class 7 notes are much riskier therefore and will pay a much higher coupon to investors, we’re told they are unlikely to be submitted for rating.The Class 3 tranche of notes which will provide per-occurrence coverage have been rated ‘BB-’ while the Class 5 notes which provide annual aggregate coverage have been rated ‘BB’. The Class 7 notes which are also annual aggregate will not be rated.The notes issued cover personal lines losses only for each peril in the covered areas. USAA are retaining at least a 10% share of losses in the attachment layer for the Class 3 and Class 5 notes. The minimum net loss to USAA from an event so that it will qualify under the terms of the deal is $50m. This will help to appease investors about the severe thunderstorm cover included as many events will not be covered under this deal with the minimum loss size in the terms.S&P reveal some detail on the historical modelling that has been done for this transaction. For the Class 3 notes, for hurricane, there have been no recorded historical events since 1900 with losses that would have reached the attachment level, and for earthquake, there have been no recorded historical events since 1800 with losses that would have reached the attachment level. According to S&P the events that generated the greatest ultimate net losses were the 1906 San Francisco earthquake ($1.956 billion), the 1812 New Madrid earthquake sequence($1.782 billion), the 1938 “Northeast Clipper” hurricane ($1.589 billion), and the 1886 Charleston earthquake ($1.539 billion).For the Class 5 notes, when combining hurricane, earthquake, and winter storm, on a historical basis there have not been any years with aggregate losses that would have reached the attachment level. The three years with the largest estimated aggregate ultimate net losses were 1954, 2004, and 2005, with loss estimates of $943 million, $782 million, and $775 million, respectively. Even the 2011 season of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes is said not to hit the attachment point for the aggregate notes.Hurricane cover is for Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Earthquake cover if for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Earthquake cover includes fire following except for in Alaska and Hawaii. Severe thunderstorm and winter storm cover is in the 48 contiguous states. Wildfire cover is for California only.Proceeds for the sale of the cat bond notes will be deposited in a different reinsurance trust account for each tranche of notes and invested in highly-rated Treasury money market funds.Update: We now have details on the total size of this Residential Reinsurance 2012 Ltd. cat bond as well as detials on the coupon its notes are expected to pay.The Class 3 tranche will be $50m, the Class 5 tranche has grown slightly to $110m and the Class 7 tranche of notes will be $40m, making the overall deal size $200m.We’ve also been told what coupon the tranches of cat bond notes will pay to investors. The Class 3, per-occurrence notes will attach at $2 billion of losses, exhaust at $2.8 billion and will pay a coupon of 10% above Treasury money market yields. The Class 5 tranche of annual aggregate notes attach at $1.571 billion of losses, exhaust at $1.975 billion and will pay a coupon of 8%. The Class 7 annual aggregate notes attach at $900m, exhaust at $1.05 billion and will pay a coupon of 22% given their much riskier profile.The deal completed on the 31st May and the three tranches of notes and the five year program were listed on the Cayman Islands Stock Exchange.S&P affirmed the ratings of the Class 3 notes at ‘BB-’ and the Class 5 notes at ‘BB’. S&P also revealed that the Class 3 notes cover 6.25% of ultimate loss between the attachment point and exhaustion point while the Class 5 notes cover approximately 27.23% of ultimate net loss between the attachment point and the exhaustion point. We don’t have that detail for the Class 7 notes.Update (19th July 2012): Two severe thunderstorm events have caused qualifying UNL losses under the terms of this cat bond deal, affecting the Class 5 annual aggregate notes. The two catastrophe events which have qualified under the terms of the deals are Catastrophe Series 77 and 78, two severe thunderstorm events (so including damage from tornadoes and hail we believe). These events have resulted in ultimate net losses of $95m and $45m respectively to USAA. This reduces the attachment point of the notes slightly making them more risky.Standard & Poor’s said that it has lowered its ratings on the Residential Reinsurance 2012 Ltd. (Series 2012-1) Class 5 notes to ‘BB-’ from ‘BB’, and placed them on CreditWatch with negative implications.Update (24th October 2012):S&P have upgraded the Class 5 notes back to their original rating of ‘BB’ due to improved loss experience. Some of the loss estimates which had originally qualified have been reduced, dropping Catastrophe Series 78 from being a qualifying event. Based on the reduced probability of attachment this results in, the rating downgrade was reversed.Update (16th November 2012):The Class 5 notes are back on Creditwatch after USAA released a loss estimate from hurricane Sandy (Catastrophe Series 90) which means the aggregate protection will be eroded further.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

This does mean that the coupon paid to investors is expected to be high making the deal attractive to them.The Pelican Re deal began marketing as a $100m single tranche of notes but increased in size to $125m before close. The notes have a low attachment point as Lousiana Citizens are seeking a robust layer of cover. The notes attach at $200m of losses and the exhaustion point is set at $400m.

Series 2012-1 is the first issuance under this program and is seeking to issue a $200m cat bond in two Series 2012-1 tranches of $100m of notes. The deal upsized before close with each tranche growing to $120m and the deal becoming $240m in size.The transaction is designed to provide Allianz with a source of fully collateralized cover for certain U.S. hurricane, U.S. earthquake, Canada earthquakes, Caribbean hurricane and Mexican hurricane risks. Cover will use a modelled/modified industry loss trigger which will weight the cover to Allianz’s own portfolio of risk.The modelled/modified industry loss trigger will weight any event industry losses against Allianz’s market share in the covered area, thus providing a trigger mechanism that is better matched to Allianz’s actual covered business. Cover from Blue Danube is for both personal and commercial (including industrial) lines of business.Swiss Re said in a press release that they developed the trigger for this cat bond, using a modelled industry trigger transaction (MITT) which takes industry loss estimates for the U.S. and Canada and weights them after the event against certain applicable modelled portfolios.The Class A notes provide cover above an index value attachment point of 200, up to an exhaustion point of 225. The Class B notes have an attachment point of 112.5 and an exhaustion point of 162.5.GC Securities highlighted the addition of other hurricane regions as ‘clash’ coverage. We think that what they mean here is that it’s unlikely that a hurricane hitting the Caribbean, Mexico or Central America will trigger the cat bond alone. Rather they will contribute to the index value of a storm which goes on to strike the U.S. mainland (or in reverse hits the U.S. first). This is a pretty clever way to extend the coverage provided if it is the case. This would also fit very well with the innovative trigger approach of using a modeled industry trigger transaction (MITT) structure that weights PCS losses in the covered area by modeled losses to Allianz’s notional exposure portfolio.PCS will provide event data to AIR who will then establish whether a covered event has occurred under the terms of the transaction. AIR will also calculate the market share factors after the event using modelled loss techniques and using that and the event data calculate an index value for each event. There are three annual risk periods after each of which various factors can be reset.Allianz Argos 14 GmbH is the counterparty to the risk transfer contracts in this transaction, Allianz SE acts as guarantor for its obligations under the risk transfer contracts.The collateral from the sale of the notes will be invested in International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) putable notes.The Blue Danube transaction will run for a three-year period from April 3rd 2012 to April 2nd 2015.Horseshoe Group are acting as administrator for the Blue Danube Ltd.

Combine Re Ltd. will issue a cat bond which will provide Swiss Re America with retrocessional protection for two reinsurance deals they have with two clients. It’s the first time multiple reinsureds have been combined into a single cat bond deal.Cover will be afforded on an annual aggregate basis and the transaction uses an indemnity trigger based on the ultimate net loss of the two reinsureds. The two reinsureds are Country Mutual Insurance Company and the North Carolina Farm Bureau’s mutual insurance arm.Covered perils are U.S. hurricane, U.S. earthquake, U.S. severe thunderstorm and U.S. winter storm. Cover is to be split 50/50 for the reinsureds in that it is designed to provide $100m of cover to each of them. The North Carolina Farm Bureau is only at risk (and therefore covered) in North Carolina, where as Country Mutual is said to be receiving cover for all peril exposed U.S. States except for Florida and California. A full breakdown of the covered area is at the bottom.Combine Re Ltd. will protect Swiss Re America and the two reinsureds for 2.75 years, with three risk periods, and is due to mature at the end of 2014.The deal has three tranches:
Clas A – $100m
Class B – $50m
Class C – $50mMoody’s have given the $100m Class A Series 2012-1 tranche of notes that are being issued by Combine Re have achieved a provisional rating of ‘Baa1′ which is considered an investment grade rating. The $50m Class B tranche has a provisional rating of ‘Ba3′.The $100m Class A notes, which have received the investment grade rating, have a one year expected loss of 0.01%, an attachment probability of 0.04% and an exhaustion probability of 0.00%. These notes will pay a coupon of 4.5% above Treasuries.The $50m Class B notes, have a one year expected loss of 0.54%, an attachment probability of 0.80% and an exhaustion probability of 0.34%. These notes pay a coupon of 10% above TMMF.The $50m Class C notes, have a one year expected loss of 1.91%, an attachment probability of 3.14% and an exhaustion probability of 0.80%. These notes are much more risky and pay a coupon of 17.75%.Proceeds from the sale of the notes will be deposited in equal amounts in two separate collateral trust accounts and the proceeds invested in Treasuries or other highly rates assets.Covered area and perils:The covered area breakdown is quite complex for this deal given the two reinsureds and the fact that one is NC only.Country Mutual Hurricane: AL, AR, CT, DE, GA, HI, IL, IN, KY, LA, MA, MD, ME, MO, MS, NH, NJ, NY, OH, OK, PA, RI, SC, TN, TX, VA, VT, WV, and D.C.Country Mutual Earthquake: The 50 U.S. States and D.C., except CA, FL and NC (Fire Following excluded in AK and HI)Country Mutual Severe Thunderstorm: The 48 contiguous U.S. states and D.C., except CA, FL and NCCOUNTRY Mutual Winter Storm Covered Area: The 48 contiguous U.S. states and D.C., except CA, FL and NCNCFB – all perils: North CarolinaUpdate – 14th August 2012:Rating agency Moody’s reported that the Class B tranche of notes were downgraded due to qualifying losses from a number of severe thunderstorm events.Based on an estimated loss report, Country Mutual Insurance estimates that they will suffer an aggregate ultimate net loss from three catastrophe events, PCS No. 74, PCS No. 77 and PCS No. 83, totalling $110.3m. These three events correspond to severe thunderstorms that occurred on 28th-29th April, 6th-7th June and 28th June-7th July, respectively.The losses estimated are not sufficient to cause any loss to the Class B Combine Re notes but they will reduce the attachment point significantly, thus raising the risk of attachment for the transaction in future during the first risk period. The amount of additional losses now required to reach the attachment level has been reduced to $189.7m from its initial level of $300m for this tranche of notes. Moody’s notes that this does not affect the attachment level for North Carolina Farm Bureau losses.Moody’s have downgraded the Class B notes from ‘Ba3’ to ‘B1’ as a result of the estimated loss report.It has become clear that the unrated tranche of Class C notes will not be exposed to any loss as the underlying reinsurance cover for Country Mutual Insurance is for excess of $300m of losses.Update – 11th September 2012:According to rating agency Moody’s, losses from Isaac have qualified under the terms of the Combine Re Ltd. (Series 2012-1) cat bond transaction. While these losses are insufficient to cause direct principal losses, they will further erode the transactions protective reinsurance retention layer thus reducing its attachment point and making future losses of principal to investors more probable.Moody’s says that hurricane Isaac, which is estimated to have caused an insured loss of between $500m and $2 billion, has caused credit negative losses for investors in the Combine Re cat bond. Moody’s said that Combine Re bondholders will not sustain principal losses owing to this event, but Isaac will consume some more of the protective subordination layer of the deal, leaving investors more vulnerable to losses from future qualifying events, which is credit negative.Moody’s notes that this leaves Combine Re investors more vulnerable, saying that the first loss layer which sits below the rated tranches of notes will absorb the potential ultimate net losses for this event. This, said Moody’s, leaves the cat bond investors more vulnerable to future losses due to an effective lowering of the attachment point. Moody’s explained; “This vulnerability arises from the fact that the rated tranches in this transaction incur losses to the extent the attachment point is less than the aggregate losses on all qualifying events in a calendar year, rather the loss on each individual event.”The landfall event of hurricane Isaac as a Category 1 hurricane on the Louisiana coastline qualified it as a covered event under Country Mutual’s underlying book of insurance business, said Moody’s.Moody’s have not discussed how much the ultimate net loss from hurricane Isaac will be to Country Mutual and so we do not at this time know how much further the attachment point has been reduced.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The duration of East Lane Re V is four years and so will provide protection until March 2016.East Lane Re V Ltd. is a newly formed Cayman Islands domiciled SPV established to issue cat bond notes designed to protect certain Chubb subsidiaries against U.S. hurricanes and severe thunderstorms in certain U.S. States. East Lane Re V has been set up as a shelf program which would allow Chubb to issue future series of notes through the entity.Cover will be afforded on a per-occurrence basis and the deal utilises an indemnity trigger.The deal will involve two classes of notes which will both be exposed to U.S. hurricanes and severe thunderstorms in the States of Alabama, Florida, North & South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. A $75m Class A tranche of notes and a $50m Class B tranche are currently being marketed.Covered losses are for personal lines property exposures within Chubb’s subsidiaries books of business only and are based on Chubb’s ultimate net losses.The Class A notes will provide cover for a percentage of losses above an attachment point of $1 billion up to an exhaustion point of $1.15 billion. The Class B notes attach at $850m up to $950m. The Class A notes have a probability of attachment of 1.59%, annual expected loss of 1.4% and a probability of exhaustion of 1.23%. Class B has a probability of attachment of 2.11%, annual expected loss of 1.91% and a probability of exhaustion of 1.76%. There will be three annual resets during the four-year deal term.Based on risk analysis only one historical event would have triggered this deal, an unamed 1928 hurricane would have caused a 100% loss to the Class B notes and a 68% loss to the Class A. Standard & Poor’s note that the contribution to expected losses by peril is split as hurricane 88%/87% and severe thunderstorm just 12%/13% for each Class of notes. Also of interest is the fact that Florida will contribute almost 70% of the expected loss by state.The collateral proceeds from the sale of the notes will be deposited into separate reinsurance trust accounts for each class of notes and will be invested in highly rated Treasury money market funds.The Class A notes are expected to price somewhere in the range of 8%-9% above Treasury money market funds. The Class B notes are expect to price between 10%-11% above TMMF.Target size is $125m but this deal could upsize before closing.Update:East Lane Re V Ltd. closed at $150m. The $75m of Class A notes didn’t upsize and priced at the top end of the range at 9% above TMMF. The riskier Class B tranche of notes, which have a lower attachment point, upsized to $75m and priced slightly under the top of the guidance range at 10.75% above TMMF.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Mystic Re III has been set up as a shelf program to allow for further issuances.In this issuance Mystic Re III is to issue two tranches of notes which will cover losses from hurricanes and earthquakes, including fire following, in the covered area on an indemnity and per-occurrence basis.In this Series 2012-1 deal Liberty Mutual are hoping to achieve a source of indemnified risk transfer via a reinsurance agreement on a per-occurrence basis over a three-year risk period. The deal is scheduled to mature at some point in February 2015.Mystic Re III will issue two tranches of Series 2012-1 notes. Both classes of notes will be exposed to the ultimate net losses of Liberty Mutual from qualifying U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes (including fire following) in personal and commercial lines of business. The Class A notes, targeting $75m in size, have an initial attachment level of $2.1 billion and an exhaustion level of $2.433 billion. The Class B notes provide a lower level of cover and attach at an indemnity loss figure of $1.3 billion and have an exhaustion point of $2.1 billion. So this cat bond aims to provide at least $150m of cover for indemnity losses suffered by Liberty Mutual between $1.3 billion and $2.433 billion. The amount of principal lost will we assume be on a sliding scale depending on the level of ultimate net loss between attachment and exhaustion points.The probability of attachment and expected loss for each tranche of notes is as follows: 1.51% and 1.38% for the Class A notes and 3.01% and 2.17% for the Class B notes. There will be an annual reset at which time the attachment points will be reset so as to keep the probability of attachments the same. The initial probabilities of exhaustion for the notes are 1.25% for Class A and 1.63% for Class B.The covered area for hurricane is: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.The covered area for earthquake is all 50 states and the District of Columbia, though the Class A notes will not cover losses in California from earthquakes.Interestingly, the risk modelling shows that historical events that would have impacted the notes are not the usual events that you might have thought. For example, a historical Cat 3 hurricane which hit New York in 1938 comes closest to exhausting the deal and Katrina wouldn’t have triggered it, showing that Liberty Mutual’s coverage has a strong focus on the northeast for hurricane risks. Similarly on earthquakes, a historical New Madrid quake in 1812 would have exhausted both classes of notes while other major quakes would not.Collateral proceeds from the sale of the Mystic Re III cat bond notes will be invested in highly rated Treasury money market funds.Standard & Poor’s have assigned ratings of ‘BB’ for the Mystic Re II Ltd. Series 2012-1 Class A notes and ‘B’ for the Series 2012-1 Class B notes.Update: During the final days of the marketing phase the Mystic Re III cat bond almost doubled in size to $275m. Class A jumped to $100m and Class B to $175m. Class A will pay a coupon of Treasury money market funds plus 9% and Class B 12%.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

This deal is being issued by Queen Street V Re Ltd., a Bermuda domiciled SPV established for this transaction.Queen Street V Re Ltd. is seeking to issue $75m of catastrophe bond notes exposed to U.S. hurricanes and European windstorms. U.S. north Atlantic hurricanes in certain States (details below) will be covered from April 2012 to March 2015 (three hurricane seasons). European windstorm coverage in specified European countries will be from October 2012 and March 2015 (three European windstorm seasons). The three years of fully collateralized cat bond cover will give Munich Re industry loss based retrocessional protection on a per-occurrence basis for these two peak perils.The index based industry-loss cover will be triggered based on indices from Property Claims Services (PCS) for U.S. hurricane risks and PERILS AG for European windstorm cover. AIR Worldwide provide risk modelling services.Following a qualifying event, AIR will calculate an index value against which a triggering event will be determined. The notes provide protection to Munich Re for U.S. hurricane losses above an index value of 104,000, up to 136,000 and Europe windstorm losses above an index value of 16,400 up to an index value of 19,925 (both on a per-occurrence basis). For U.S. hurricanes, county level PCS industry loss data and predetermined payout factors by county and line of business will be used to determine the index value. For European windstorm events industry loss data reported by PERILS and CRESTA Zone level predetermined payout factors will be used.The Queen Street V Re notes cover U.S. hurricanes that cause losses in the District of Columbia and the following U.S. states: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia.European windstorm coverage is in the following European countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.Modelling shows that no recent historical events, either U.S. hurricanes or European windstorms would have reached the index level attachment points and caused a loss to these notes.The notes have a base expected loss of 1.8%. Initial attachment probability has been set at a base of 2.42%. Guidance pricing for the notes has been put at between 7.9% and 8.5% above money market funds. The deal finally priced at 8.5%.Proceeds from the sale of the notes issued by Queen Street V Re Ltd. will be invested in pre-selected U.S. Treasury money market funds rated ‘AAAm’.Ratings agency Standard & Poor’s have assigned a rating of ‘B+’ to the single $75m tranche of Queen Street V Re notes.Update August 2013:S&P said that the risk modeller and calculation agent for the transaction AIR Worldwide released a reset report on the 1st July, detailing new attachment and exhaustion points based on updated exposure information.For U.S. hurricanes risks, the updated attachment point is an index value of 110,944 (from 104,000) and the updated exhaustion point is an index value of 143,863 (from 136,000). For European windstorms, the updated attachment point is an index value of 13,067 (from 16,569) and the updated exhaustion point is an index value of 16,174 (from 20,414).S&P notes that since the Queen Street V Re cat bond was issued in February 2012, the sponsor Munich Re has shifted its exposures in Europe towards the UK from France and Germany. As well as this shift in exposure, PERILS industry exposure database has seen an increase in market penetration.This has led to a change in the CRESTA Zone level payout factors in Europe, which coupled with risk modeller AIR’s disaggregation process has resulted in a lasting change in the shape of the “exceedance probability” curve for Queen Street V Re over time, according to S&P.So, while the change in attachment points detailed above could make it looks like the European windstorm risk profile has increased, the changes in exposure, moving towards the UK, actually means that the risk of an event causing sufficient losses to reach the attachment point has decreased significantly enough to warrant a lift in the rating. Here the payout factors show their importance in calculating the probability of attachment and EP curve for a cat bond and show that the attachment point should not be looked at in isolation.After taking these new findings into account, S&P has adjusted the rating on the catastrophe risk to ‘BB-’ from ‘B+’, and as a result has also raised the rating on the Queen Street V Re notes to ‘BB- (sf)’ from ‘B+ (sf)’.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Series 2012-1 cat bond notes.This 2012-1 deal will use an indemnity trigger based on the CEA’s actual loss experience on an annual aggregate basis over three loss occurrence periods. This provides a source of indemnified risk transfer via a reinsurance agreement for a three year period.The notes provide cover for first and subsequent qualifying earthquake events over three risk periods. To qualify, an earthquake does not actually have to be centered in California, rather it has to cause losses to the CEA in California, meaning quakes in neighboring States are covered.The deal provides indemnified cover to the CEA via a reinsurance agreement with Embarcadero Reinsurance Ltd. to whom the CEA will cede the subject book of business. The book of business is purely residential property and no commercial property insurance portfolio is included.The Series 2011-1 Class A notes which Embarcadero Re issued in August 2011, have an attachment point of $3.287 billion. This second cat bond provides cover beneath that, the first loss period has an attachment point of $2.91 billion and an exhaustion point of $3.21 billion.Smaller quakes are covered as part of the aggregate and if one occurs and causes a smaller loss to the CEA the attachment point for the notes gets adjusted to maintain or increase the probability of attachment, depending on the size of the ultimate net loss. As an aggregate deal qualifying losses have to breach the attachment point of $2.91 billion before noteholders lose any principal, so smaller quakes could keep mounting up and the probability of attachment will be adjusted up to a maximum of 3.5% in any one loss period. The standard probability of attachment for the deal is 2.36%.Collateral from the sale of the notes will be deposited in a collateral account and invested in U.S. Treasury money market funds.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The notes are designed to provide fully collateralized multiyear protection to Hannover Re, and ultimately their reinsured Zenkyoren, on a per occurrence basis. A paremtric index based trigger will be used to measure events against the cat bond using data from Japanese earthquake monitoring network K-Net.The Kibou Ltd. Series 2012-1 cat bond notes provide protection for earthquake losses above an event index value of 1050 and below an event index value of 1150. A dropdown feature means that if a first event reaches an index value of 270 or greater then the notes will provide coverage for any subsequent events in excess of an event index value of 490 and below a value of 590.Kibou Ltd. has been specifically structured to be tailored to provide more remote earthquake protection initially.Additionally, if a qualifying earthquake event happens, the protection will adjust with a higher risk profile. In return for this increased drop-down based cover, investors will receive an increased coupon post-drop-down relative to the initial coupon that the notes pay. The initial coupon paid is Treasury money market funds plus 5%, after a drop-down event that changes to plus 9%. That’s an interesting feature as it should keep investors interest in the bond high even if a first event qualifies.The deal also allows for a new risk model to be used after a reset if the new model increases the expected loss by more than 10%. An event index value will be calculated using peak ground acceleration data from the Kyoshin K-Net network of earthquake monitoring stations.

Assurant have established a new Cayman Islands SPV Ibis Re II Ltd. which will seek to issue two tranches of Series 2012-1 notes in this current deal.Both tranches will provide U.S. hurricane cover to Assurant over a 3 year period on a per-occurrence industry loss basis.This deal uses the new Verisk Catastrophe Index for trigger purposes, the first cat bond to do so, giving them county-weighted loss data which should make the transaction quite robustly modeled.The tranches were originally sized at $70m and $30m giving Assurant another $100m of cat bond cover. However the Class A tranche grew to $100m making the total for the transaction $130m by close.The Class A notes cover is for a pro-rata share of losses in excess of $1.05 billion (the Class A attachment level) up to $1.855 billion (the Class A exhaustion level), on a per-occurrence basis. The Class B notes will cover a pro-rata share losses above $610 million (the Class B attachment level) up to $1.05 billion (the Class B exhaustion level), also on a per-occurrence basis.The trigger for calculation and measurement of the severity of an event and any associated losses will be the Verisk catastrophe index reports which show insured personal line losses on a county level multiplied by predetermined county payout factors (weighting). This is the first time that the Verisk index has been used for cat bond trigger and calculation purposes, although Verisk are the parent company of PCS so it is not a completely unknown quantity.The transaction can be extended by up to 24 months for loss development and reporting purposes and the attachment and exhaustion levels can be reset annually using up to date exposure information and the county payout factors to determine new attachment probabilities and expected loss. The initial probability of attachment for the Class A notes will be 2.33% and for the Class B notes 4.95%.Risk modelling and calculation services are provided by AIR Worldwide for this deal. In their analysis they found that a hurricane the size of the 1992 hurricane Andrew could have triggered the Class A attachment point. One other historical event could have breached the Class A notes attachment point and two other historical hurricane events could have breached the Class B attachment point.Collateral from the sale of the notes will be deposited in reinsurance trust accounts and invested in highly rated U.S. Treasury money market funds.Ibis Re II will cover losses in the following areas: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.Update: The Class A tranche of notes has increased to $100m during the marketing phase meaning this deal should complete at $130m of cover for Assurant.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Those investors would become liable to lose principal should a medical benefit claims ratio exceed an index point of 103% for the Class A notes and 97% for the Class B notes.At the start of this transaction, Health Re enters into excess of loss agreements with Vitality Re III, which provide coverage if the medical benefit ratio of the covered book of business (commercial accident and health business only) is higher than the specified trigger levels. Vitaity Re III funds the excess of loss agreements by selling the notes and reduces the principal if payments are due under the excess of loss contracts. Vitality Re III establishes a credit-for-reinsurance trust account for each of the two classes of notes and loss payments due will be made into them. Health Re will make interest payments to Vitality Re III to fund the coupon payments in the notes.At the end of each year, if the covered business medical benefit ratio exceeds the attachment point, the outstanding principal will be reduced by the amount of claims paid under the excess of loss agreements.Proceeds from the sale of the notes will be deposited into a collateral trust account and will be invested in highly rated money market funds. Interest from this makes up part of the coupon payments.The deal is structured in two tranches:
Class A – $105m
Class B at $45mUpdate:Interestingly, S&P have issued positive comments() on the two previous Vitality Re transactions saying that an improved claims experience will lead to a lower probability of attachment and a ratings upgrade.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Through the deal Amlin AG are seeking $75m of fully collateralized multi-year reinsurance cover from the capital markets on an annual aggregate basis for three years until December 2014. The risks being covered are certain of Amlin AG’s U.S. hurricane, U.S. earthquake, and Europe windstorm risks.The covered areas are. U.S. hurricane: the usual Gulf, Florida and Eastern coastal states. U.S. earthquake: California, plus other states including, Tennessee, Washington, Oregon, Arkansas, Indiana, Missouri, South Carolina, Kentucky, Illinois, Mississippi (we think this has broadened to include every U.S. state). European windstorm: U.K., France, The Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, Norway, Luxembourg.This 2011-1 Series of notes is the first under a possible prorogram which Amlin have sponsored, meaning they could be looking to regular issue cat bonds under Tramline Re. This issue is by Amlin AG but the program is set up so that other Amlin PLC subsidiaries could use the Tramline cat bond program in future.This cat bond is an annual aggregate deal with three risk periods of one year each. The trigger point is at an index value of 630 up to 730 and a qualifying event must have an index level of 75 or above to contribute to the aggregate. The annual aggregate nature of this cat bond will provide Amlin with a source of cover for both frequency and severity events.The aggregate level resets annually to zero. Payout factors may also be reset for each peril using the most recent industry exposure data.The deal can be extended by 24 months in 3 month increments unless there has been a U.S. earthquake in which case the extension is 36 months (we assume to allow for loss development as earthquakes can take much longer for the full impacts to be known).After an event, AIR will receive an event notice and then calculate an event index to establish whether it qualifies.In order for the notes to face a loss, it’s said that an event the size of the 1926 U.S. hurricane or the 1906 San Francisco earthquake would be required. The annualized probability of attachment is 4.34%.Collateral from the sale of the notes will be invested in U.S Treasury money market firms.The deal is pricing somewhere in the range of 1650-1750 basis points above money market funds.Update: Tramline Re Ltd. upsized before close to $150m.

Golden State Re Ltd. is a Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurer set up for the purpose of providing $200m of coverage to the California State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF) for claims they may have to pay resulting from earthquakes. This is the first time the SCIF have issued a cat bond.The SCIF provides workers compensation coverage to employers in the State of California and so can be liable for claims such as injuries and fatalities which could result from an earthquake damaging a covered workplace.Golden State Re Ltd. is issuing a single tranche of $200m of Series 2011-1 Class A notes with the aim of securing a source of index-based risk transfer via ISDA-based reinsurance agreement for SCIF. The deal provides cover to the SCIF on a per-occurrence basis over just more than three years, with maturity scheduled for January 2015.Golden State Re Ltd. uses a modelled loss approach to calculate an index to determine whether an earthquake has triggered the notes. It will use a notional portfolio of workers compensation risks, earthquake severity factors (ground motion) and time of day and the day of week an event occurs as weighting factors. This is a unique approach as places of work are plainly busier during working hours and on weekdays rather than weekends, so events outside of average normal working hours will result in a lower impact on the modelled loss calculation.An index will be created with weighting of the above factors using RMS’ U.S. earthquake model. The notes cover a pro rate share of losses from the index attachment point of 1,000 up to the index exhaustion point of 1,447. Losses will be modelled deterministically using the earthquake event parameters (ground motion etc) and modelled against the notional portfolio using the day and time-of-day weighting to determine an index value and notional modelled loss calculation. Standard & Poor’s call this a parametric modelled loss trigger and note it can help to reduce modelling errors and implies a lower level of modelling risk than industry-loss or indemnity triggers.The covered area under the terms of the deal means that a qualifying earthquake event can occur in any of the 50 U.S. States and the District of Colombia. However 99.99% of the SCIF exposure in the notional portfolio are in California. This means any losses resulting from a severe quake in neighbouring states could be covered under the terms of the deal and possibly any workers comp claims from covered workers travelling to other States may also be protected.The SCIF is an unrated entity, which isn’t the norm in cat bond deals, so they will be depositing two quarterly interest payments in advance to mitigate noteholders exposure to them.The deal features an annual reset on 1st November at which point the most recent notional portfolio and payout factors will be included in the modelling by reset agent RMS.Initial probability of attachment is 0.55%. After each reset it will be no higher than that except the final year when the term will be more than a full year when it will be 0.56%. Initial annual modeled expected loss is 0.36% and probability of exhaustion is 0.22%.The payout factors mentioned above are the model’s assumptions of the cost of various types of injuries simulated by the model.S&P say that three historical events (the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake, and the 1994 Northridge earthquake) would have breached the attachment point if they had occurred between 8am and 4pm. The reason for this is the time/day weighting which means events that happen when the most people are in the workplace have the greatest loss potential. 2pm on a working weekday is the time of the greatest exposure for this cat bond (an event occurring at 4am for example, or even 2pm on a public holiday, would have a markedly different modelled loss amount). So actually, no known historical event would have caused this deal to trigger. However modelling does show that an event of under M6.5 could trigger the deal if it hit in the most exposed locations at the most exposed times.Collateral from this deal will be invested in highly rated Treasury money market funds.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The two catastrophe events which have qualified under the terms of the deals are Catastrophe Series 77 and 78, two severe thunderstorm events (so including damage from tornadoes and hail we believe). These events have resulted in ultimate net losses of $95m and $45m respectively to USAA.We don’t know if these events have affected this 2011-2 issuance but it is a possibility so worth noting.Update (24th October 2012):S&P have upgraded the rating on the two rated cat bonds Residential Re 2011-1 and 2012-1 again as the loss estimates had been reduced. Again, we’re unsure if that affects this transaction but it is worth being aware of.Update (16th November 2012):USAA released a loss estimate from hurricane Sandy (Catastrophe Series 90) which means the aggregate protection will be eroded further on the aggregate tranche of these notes, although as they are unrated we haven’t heard anything official on that.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

EQECAT will reset attachment and exhaustion points accordingly each year to ensure that the one year modelled attachment and loss probabilities never get higher than the level they are initially set at.The modelling for the transaction shows that none of the major European windstorms experienced in the last few decades would have qualified as an event as they would not have generated a sufficiently high index value.Collateralization will be achieved through the use of a collateral account and purchase and investment of European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) floating-rate notes.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

"Hoplon Insurance Ltd.","Hoplon Insurance Ltd.","MyLotto24","inea GmbH","Milliman Inc.","Lottery jackpot risk","$101m","Indemnity","NA","Sep 2011","This innovative €70.5m (US$101m) transaction provides lottery company MyLotto24 with protection against lottery winnings in their games exceeding a pre-set amount over a three year period.Privately placed and using a Bermuda based SPV this deal put a cat bond type structure to work in a completely new risk arena.Update August 2013:The Hoplon ILS transaction, which was structured by inea GmbH, a German firm who structure and offer investment opportunities including insurance-linked securities, was originally issued in 2011 and consisted of a €33m catastrophe bond type layer and a collateralized reinsurance layer of €37.5m, over the deals three-year term.The bond layer provides three-year, aggregate protection to MyLotto24 from the transactions inception in 2011. The collateralized reinsurance portion of the Hoplon structure is an annual reinsurance layer with a reinstatement feature.We spoke with Dr. Norbert Kranz of inea GmBH, the firm responsible for the unique transaction, to get a better understanding of what has changed.Dr. Kranz told us that the Hoplon deal had first changed in 2012, when MyLotto24 chose to expand the coverage of the transaction by including a new lottery and the risks of exceptional jackpot wins for this new lottery game within the deal. In 2013 some risk factors have changed and have been taken into account, these risk factors can include the volume of tickets potentially covered by the transaction and changes to lottery rules for example.The transaction, which uses Milliman Inc. as a reset agent, features a typical reset mechanism which aims to ensure that the expected loss of the bond remains the same for the deals duration. However the deal allows for the expected loss to be increased should the investors give approval to this.Dr. Norbert Kranz commented; “Investors like the reset feature, as although you need some time to re-adjust factors, you can ensure that the risk and reward to investors remains the same over the lifetime of the transaction.”When the deal launched the collateralized reinsurance, of €37.5m over three years, equated to €12.5m per annual reinsurance contract. MyLotto24 has increased this layer considerably, bringing the total deal size to €84m, with the collateralized coverage equaling €25.5m per annual risk period with 15 months remaining on the deals term until maturity. The volume of notes issued remains €33m. So MyLotto24 has effectively doubled its annual collateralized reinsurance cover from the transaction.The transaction has also seen changes to risk factors after agreement from noteholders the expected loss for Hoplon Insurance Ltd. has now been increased to 2.6% and as a result the coupon paid to investors has also been increased to European money market funds plus 12%. That’s a very healthy multiple for investors when you compare it to those on recent catastrophe bond transactions.Dr. Kranz explained a little about MyLotto24′s motivations behind this deal, saying; “MyLotto24 is a strategic buyer of ILS as part of their hedging tools. In this context MyLotto24 is not acting as an oppportunistic buyer using the current market environment, but wants to build long term relationships with both existing investors and interested investors who might invest in this type of risk in the future. MyLotto24 is keen to see that both sides benefit from this type of transaction.”Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The transaction secures €150m of European windstorm coverage for mainland France on a per-occurrence basis over the risk period. Covered areas are the whole of France excluding Corsica and any overseas territories. Two tranches are being issued, €65m of Class A notes and €85m of Class B notes. Maturity is scheduled for the end of April 2016 making this a longer duration deal compared to most cat bonds. That length of deal must be attractive to EDF as they secure a layer of reinsurance cover for five full European windstorm seasons.The risk transfer counterparty in the transaction is French bank Natixis. Natixis in turn enter into separate financial contracts with EDF subsidiary Electricite Reseau Distribution France (ERDF). Natixis are also arranging this deal.The transaction will utilise parametric triggers with EQECAT acting as calculation and reset agent and data being used from the reporting agent METNEXT’s (a subsidiary of Meteo-France) network of wind speed monitoring stations. EQECAT will calculate an index value following any qualifying events based on the wind speeds measured and on predetermined weights by location.The notes provide protection above an index value of 777 (for Class A) and 420 (for Class B), up to an index value of 1,050 (class A) and 777 (class B) on a per-occurrence basis. The Class A notes have a drop-down feature which is activated if the Class B notes suffer a partial or total loss of principal, the Class A notes attachment and exhaustion points will be lowered to ensure that there is no gap in cover afforded. This also allows the Class A notes to provide cover from the attachment point of 420 should the Class B notes suffer a total loss. Standard & Poor’s note that this could have happened in 1999 with windstorms Lothar and Martin. Should the Class A notes drop-down they will be reassessed by rating agency S&P and if neccessary they will ammend the Class A notes ratings to reflect an increased probability of attachment.Proceeds from the sale of the €150m (US$216m) notes will be invested in a global master repurchase agreement (tri-party repo) with Natixis as the counterparty.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

This transaction will be issued through Bermuda based special purpose insurer Embarcadero Reinsurance Ltd. which has been set up specifically for this transaction and was incorporated in Bermuda on the 22nd June. It’s a single tranche cat bond deal with a size of $150m.Embarcadero Re Ltd. provides the CEA with indemnified risk transfer for a layer of their state of California earthquake risks via a reinsurance agreement on an annual aggregate basis over a three-year risk period. It covers only earthquake shake risks, not other perils often associated with quakes such as tsunami or fire following. Only residential property is covered. The deal matures in August 2014.Covered losses are based on the ultimate net loss of the CEA, based on the claims payments they made after a quake event. The attachment point for the first loss period will be $3.287 billion and investor principal will only begin to be eroded once that point is passed. The actual epicentre of an earthquake does not have to be within the California state bounds for it to qualify as the CEA covers losses for earthquake shaking within the state, no matter where the epicentre occurs.The deal is reset annually but the losses from a previous year can be carried over to count to the aggregate amount in certain cases. This aggregate qualifying losses can continue to affect the attachment point for each year of the deals lifetime which is a useful feature for the CEA as smaller quakes which happen more regularly will make the likelihood of a payment increase slightly.Pproceeds of the sale of the notes will be deposited in a collateral account and invested in U.S. Treasury money market funds. Interest will be paid quarterly at a rate equal to the investment yield on U.S. money market funds plus an interest spread which is equal to the premium payment from the CEA. The rate of interest may change based on any change in the probability of attachment due to covered events.Interestingly, the CEA managed to close this deal at a cheaper cost than the equivalent in traditional reinsurance making similar structures more appealing to other corporate issuers.

Cayman Islands domiciled SPV. Covered mortality events would include pandemics, epidemics, disasters, terrorist attacks etc.The first $100m of Series V Class D notes provide cover against catastrophic mortality in Canada and Germany. The second $80m of Series VI Class E notes provide cover against catastrophic mortality events in Canada, Germany, the U.K. and the U.S. (including the District of Columbia but excluding Puerto Rico and overseas territories).The notes are designed to provide Swiss Re with some protection against qualifying extreme mortality events affecting specified age and gender distributions in the covered countries.The investors are at risk of an increase in age and gender-weighted mortality rates that exceed a specified percentage of a predefined index (the mortality index value; MIV) in the covered areas. The risk period for this transaction runs until 31st December 2015.Standard & Poor’s explained; “The MIV will be defined on a rolling two-year period, and the probability of a loss attaching and the magnitude of the loss in principal will depend on the extent to which the MIV for any country and measurement period (that is, two consecutive years) exceeds the attachment point for the notes. Index values corresponding to future measurement periods will be measured against the index value for 2010 for all four covered countries. Adjustments will be applied for changes in mortality over the risk period.”At the close of the transaction, Swiss Re entered into an ISDA standard swap contract with the issuer, exchanging payments for extreme mortality protection. The proceeds of the issuance will be invested in ‘AAA’ rated notes issued by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and placed in a collateral account. Coupon payments will be taken from the payments made under the ISDA contract and the investment earnings on the collateral which is held in trust.This mortality cat bond started as a $100m transaction but by close had upsized to secure Swiss Re $180m of cover.

"Queen Street III Capital Ltd.","Queen Street III Capital Ltd.","Munich Re","Munich Re are arranging the deal. GC Securities are sole bookrunner","AIR Worldwide","European windstorm","$150m","Industry loss index","S&P: 'CC'","Jul 2011","Queen Street III Capital Ltd. issued $150m of notes in a single tranche which provide Munich Re with cover on a per-occurrence basis over a three-year period against certain European windstorms.The deal runs for three years and expected maturity is in July 2014, with the chance to extend for losses to develop in three-month increments for up to two years.The notes cover major windstorms in the following countries; Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and the UK.For a windstorm event to qualify under the terms of the cat bond deal and hit the industry loss trigger point, they must result in an index value of above 10,000 up to an index value of 15,000. The index will be calculated by risk modeller AIR Worldwide using industry loss data provided by PERILS AG, enhanced by industry exposure data provided by AIR Worldwide.Each year Munich Re can choose whether to reset the windstorm payout factors while the industry exposure data must be reset. AIR Worldwide will reset attachment and exhaustion points annually on the 15th June so that the new attachment probability and expected loss are equal to or less than the initial one-year attachment probability and the initial one-year expected loss for Europe windstorm. Interestingly there is a reset limitation which means that the contribution to the expected loss for storms hitting France, Germany and the UK combined cannot be less than 70%.Ratings agency S&P say that storm surge is a significant risk to European windstorm cat bonds. They point out that of the 299 modelled storms 13 would have caused a principal loss to this cat bond through storm surge damage affecting the UK. Something for issuers and risk modelling firms to consider as storm surge is not well modelled across Europe.Munich Re have established a new collateral fund specifically for this transaction. MEAG Queen Street III, which will be managed by a Munich Re subsidiary, was rated by S&P two days ago and is destined to hold the collateral for this transaction which will comprise highly rated U.S. Treasury bills.This deal tripled in size having begun marketing at $50m it ended up closing at $150m due to investor demand.Update 30th October 2013: Due to the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. debt ceiling, on October 11th the MEAG Queen Street III fund saw a decline in its per-unit mark-to-market value. As the fund is designed to hold the collateral until the cat bond matures or a payout is required the fund faces strict asset value guidelines which state that the per-unit value may not fall below $100.00.Because the per-unit value fell below this guideline amount the indenture trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, requested the liquidation of the fund and reinvested the remaining assets into Federal U.S. cash reserves. The proceeds from the liquidation amounted to $149,969,566.47, resulting in a loss of principal of $30,433.53, or two basis points).As a result of this loss of collateral there is now a chance that the Queen Street III Capital cat bonds investors will not receive their full principal on maturity of the notes. As a result of this, ratings agency Standard & Poor’s placed its ‘B+ (sf)’ rating on the $150m of notes issued by Queen Street III Capital on CreditWatch negative.S&P said; “The CreditWatch placement reflects that there is a one-in-two chance of a downgrade to ‘CC (sf)’ in the next three months if we consider there is a high probability that the noteholders will not receive 100% of the $150 million principal originally deposited in MEAG Queen Street III.”S&P said it may affirm the rating at ‘B+ (sf)’ if it believes that the probability of a loss of principal by the maturity date is low. This will depend on whether the collateral is able to be invested in assets which could increase in value or whether, perhaps, the issuer could elect to top-up the collateral account to $150m again.Update February 2014: Queen Street III Capital Ltd., was placed on CreditWatch over two months ago due to concerns that investors could face a reduction in capital returned after the cat bond suffered a loss of principal in the collateral account due to a decline in the collaterals per-unit mark-to-market value.The reason for the loss of value in the collateral assets was due to the uncertainty created by the U.S. debt ceiling issue. The collateral trust fund saw a decline in per-unit mark-to-market value. The fund was designed to hold the collateral until the cat bonds matured or a payout was required, meaning that the funds faced strict asset value guidelines which stated that the per-unit value could not fall below $100.00.Because the per-unit value of the fund fell below this guideline amount the indenture trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, requested the liquidation of the funds and reinvested the remaining assets into Federal U.S. cash reserves.For the Queen Street III cat bond the proceeds from the liquidation amounted to $149,969,566.47, resulting in a loss of principal of $30,433.53, or two basis points and the proceeds were reinvested in the same way.Standard & Poor’s said that the reinvested assets are not expected to regain their original net asset value. As a result S&P now believes that investors in the cat bond transactions face a heightened risk that they will not receive back 100% of the outstanding principal amount on the redemption date for each cat bond.As a result S&P has downgraded its rating on the $150 million principal-at-risk variable-rate notes issued by Queen Street III Capital to ‘CC (sf)’ from ‘B+ (sf)’. Thenotes have been removed from CreditWatch negative status.S&P explained; “Since we received the notice of default, we have monitored the performance of the Federated U.S. Treasury Cash Reserves in which the proceeds have been reinvested, and we consider that it is unlikely that the fund will regain the original net asset value on the redemption date.”S&P also noted; “Moreover, the transaction structure does not ensure that noteholders will receive back 100% of the outstanding principal amount when the notes redeem.”For the Queen Street III Capital Ltd. cat bond S&P said there would be a shortfall of $28,374.65 on the return of principal to investors at redemption date and that it also expects to downgrade this cat bonds rating to ‘D (sf)’ (Default) from ‘CC (sf)’ on July 28th 2014, when we anticipates investors will receive back $149,969,566 of the original $150m principal.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

$160m of Class 5 notes.This deal uses highly rated U.S. Treasury money market funds as a source of collateral.The Class 5 notes had to have their rating upgraded while the deal was still marketing as S&P said they hadn’t taken into account the reinsurance USAA maintain.Update (19th July 2012): Two severe thunderstorm events have caused qualifying UNL losses under the terms of this cat bond deal, affecting the Class 5 annual aggregate notes. The two catastrophe events which have qualified under the terms of the deals are Catastrophe Series 77 and 78, two severe thunderstorm events (so including damage from tornadoes and hail we believe). These events have resulted in ultimate net losses of $95m and $45m respectively to USAA. This reduces the attachment point of the notes slightly making them more risky.Standard & Poor’s said that it has lowered its ratings on the Residential Reinsurance 2011 Ltd. (Series 2011-1) Class 5 notes to ‘B’ from ‘BB-’, and placed them on CreditWatch with negative implications.Update (24th October 2012):S&P have upgraded the Class 5 notes back to their original rating of ‘BB-’ due to improved loss experience. Some of the loss estimates which had originally qualified have been reduced, dropping Catastrophe Series 78 from being a qualifying event. Based on the reduced probability of attachment this results in, the rating downgrade was reversed.Update (16th November 2012):The Class 5 notes are back on Creditwatch and have been downgraded one notch to ‘B+’ after USAA released a loss estimate from hurricane Sandy (Catastrophe Series 90) which means the aggregate protection will be eroded further.

GC Securities acted as joint-bookrunner and co-lead manager","AIR Worldwide","U.S. hurricane, European windstorm","$100m","Industry loss index","S&P: 'CC'","Mar 2011","Munich Re has issued a new catastrophe bond under an Irish special purpose vehicle, Queen Street II Capital Ltd. This is Munich Re’s second Queen Street cat bond transaction.Queen Street II Capital Ltd. will provide Munich Re with three years of protection on a per-occurrence basis against North Atlantic U.S. hurricane and European windstorms until March 2014.As well as being the counterparty in this risk transfer Munich Re are also arranging the deal themselves.The transaction provides Munich Re with cover against U.S. hurricanes in certain states (including the usual east and gulf coast states) and uses an industry loss index from PCS for measurement on that portion of the deals risk. The cover for European windstorms will be active for losses in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and the U.K. and will utilise the PERILS AG industry loss data. When losses exceed a predefined attachment point on the indices the cat bond would be triggered.AIR Worldwide are providing risk modelling for the Queen Street II cat bond using their U.S. hurricane model and European windstorm models. For European windstorms AIR will be augmenting their own industry exposure database with data from the PERILS industry exposure data. An annual reset of payout factors and exposure data will be undertaken which could result in changes to the attachment probability and expected loss after each reset.Proceeds from the sale of the notes by Queen Street II Capital Ltd. will be invested in a U.S. Treasury money market fund set up specifically for this transaction. A Munich Re subsidiary MEAGMUNICHERGO Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH, will manage the MEAG Queen Street II fund, and is seeking a triple-A rating for it.The notes priced towards the high end of guidance at 7.5% above U.S. money market funds.The notes have an expected loss of 1.59% overall, 1.09% for U.S. hurricanes and 0.5% for European windstorms.Update February 2014:Queen Street II Capital Ltd. was both placed on CreditWatch in November 2013 due to concerns that investors could face a reduction in capital returned after the cat bond suffered a loss of principal in the collateral account due to a decline in the collaterals per-unit mark-to-market value.The reason for the loss of value in the collateral assets was due to the uncertainty created by the U.S. debt ceiling issue. The collateral trust fund saw a decline in per-unit mark-to-market value. The fund was designed to hold the collateral until the cat bond matured or a payout was required, meaning that the fund faced strict asset value guidelines which stated that the per-unit value could not fall below $100.00.Because the per-unit value fell below this guideline amount the indenture trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, requested the liquidation of the fund and reinvested the remaining assets into Federal U.S. cash reserves.For the Queen Street II cat bond the loss of principal from the liquidation of the MEAG Queen Street II fund faced by investors amounted to $20,242.13, or 2 basis points. The cash proceeds from the liquidation, $99,979,757.87, were reinvested into U.S. Treasury Cash reserves.Standard & Poor’s said that the reinvested assets are not expected to regain their original net asset value. As a result S&P now believes that investors in the cat bond transaction face a heightened risk that they will not receive back 100% of the outstanding principal amount on the redemption date.As a result S&P has downgraded the rating on the $100 million principal-at-risk variable-rate notes issued by Queen Street II Capital Ltd. to ‘CC (sf)’ from ‘BB- (sf)’. The cat bond notes have been removed from CreditWatch negative status.S&P explained; “Since we received the notice of default, we have monitored the performance of the Federated U.S. Treasury Cash Reserves in which the proceeds have been reinvested, and we consider that it is unlikely that the fund will regain the original net asset value on the redemption date.”S&P also noted about both of the cat bonds; “Moreover, the transaction structure does not ensure that noteholders will receive back 100% of the outstanding principal amount when the notes redeem.”For the Queen Street II Capital Ltd. cat bond S&P said it expects a shortfall of $20,242.13 on the proceeds returned to investors at the redemption date and that it expects to lower the rating to ‘D (sf)’ (default) from ‘CC (sf)’ on April 9th 2014, when it anticipates investors will get back $99,979,757 of the original $100m of principal.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Cayman Islands SPV. The new transaction replicates the 2008 Vega Capital deal and will provides them with another $106.5m of cover against accumulated losses.The structure of the transaction affords investors more protection than some other cat bonds due to the unique use of a reserve account to add an extra layer of protection.Swiss Re said ‘An aggregate annual limit per peril combined with tranching of the Notes in order of seniority allows Swiss Re to reach investors targeting different risk/return profiles and provide investors with a diversifying multi-trigger event.’The deal provides Swiss Re with cover for some of their U.S. hurricane, European windstorm, Californian earthquake, Japanese earthquake and Japanese typhoon risks.The index triggers used for the various perils are: North Atlantic hurricane – PCS industry loss index, European windstorm – PERILS industry loss index, California earthquake – Parametric index, Japan earthquake – Parametric index and Japan typhoon – Parametric index.The collateral from the notes was used to buy AAA rated puttable notes issued by the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development.This new Vega Capital issuance is in two tranches; $63.9m of Series 2010-I Class C notes which Moody’s rated ‘Ba3’, and $42.6m of Series 2010-I Class D notes which weren’t rated. Both tranches of notes mature in three years in December 2013.Update:The Class D tranche of notes were impacted by the Japanese earthquake in March 2011. The notes themselves did not lose any principle but the reserve account was depleted by $16m.Update 2:The Class C notes were upgraded to Ba2 in February 2012 due to an improved reserve account position and a reduced remaining term.Update 3:The Class C notes were upgraded again in March 2013 due to an improved and increased level of protection in the reserve account and a shortening of the remaining risk period.The reserve account faced a $7.2m loss from hurricane Sandy and a $15.9m loss due to the Tohoku earthquake, but at March 2013 the reserve account had actually increased due to the regular payments Swiss Re makes into it.The reserve account stood at $42m in March 2013. Also, ratings agency Moody’s said that covered events from more than one of the covered perils would be required for the Class C notes to face a loss before their maturity in December 2013.Moody’s upgraded the Class C notes to ‘Baa3’.Update on loss:The Class D tranche of notes were impacted by the Japanese earthquake in March 2011. The notes themselves did not lose any principle but the reserve account was depleted by $15.9m.The Class D tranche of notes were impacted by hurricane Sandy in 2012.

Probability of loss and magnitude of loss depend on how large the divergence in mortality improvements is between the geographical age-groups and how much it exceeds a set attachment point.The index of longevity that the deals trigger will use was constructed from population mortality data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the UK Office for National Statistics (England & Wales only).Proceeds from the sale of the notes from this deal will be invested in AAA rated International Bank for Reconstruction and Development notes and deposited in a collateral account.If the longevity index divergence index value exceeds the specified trigger level some of the collateral will be sold to make payment to Swiss Re and as such the principal of the notes will be reduced (and investors see losses).The notes are listed on the Cayman Islands Stock Exchange.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The notes issued by Vitality Re will cover the claims payments of Health Re Inc. (Aetna’s reinsurance SPV), and so Aetna, against their medical benefit ratio exceeding a specific attachment point. The ratio is to be calculated on an annual aggregate basis (and will act as a kind of index of claims). Through the transaction Aetna receive a source of indemnity-based annual aggregate excess of loss reinsurance capacity against medical benefit claims above a predetermined threshold. If claims exceed the threshold then the transaction would payout and investors lose some or all of their principal.Risk modelling for this transaction is being provided by Milliman Inc. who created a simulation based stochastic model for the transaction. Standard & Poor’s who are rating the transaction say that they expect results to differ from the modelled results and so they adjust the probability of attachment using stress indicators before coming up with a rating. S&P cite pandemic as the biggest risk of loss to this transaction.Collateral is being invested in highly rated assets and the account will be over-collateralized. A tri-party repurchase agreement is then entered into between Vitality Re, Goldman Sachs and the Bank of New York.Vitality Re attempted to issue two classes of notes. $125m of Class A notes and $75m of Class B notes. The Class A notes have a medical benefit ratio attachment point of $1.3 billion and the Class B notes attach at $1.225 billion. At close Vitalty Re Ltd. only issued a single $150m tranche.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

Property Claims Services are reporting agent","U.S. severe thunderstorm","$100m","Industry loss index","S&P: 'B'","Nov 2010","This Cayman Islands based SPV issued $100m of catastrophe bond notes for cedent American Family Mutual Insurance Co. and its affiliates. Mariah Re is the first catastrophe bond transaction to solely cover severe thunderstorm risks (with the real peril covered being tornadoes that result from thunderstorms).Mariah Re Ltd. is a three year deal providing American Family Mutual Insurance Co. and its affiliates with industry loss indexed protection from severe thunderstorms across the U.S. Covered events are any severe thunderstorm with an event index equal to or greater than $10m.The initial attachment point for the first risk period is to be $825m with a maximum event index for a single event of $300m (meaning it could be triggered by as few as three major events). The attachment point will be recalculated at annual reset points. The insured industry loss amount is based on insured personal and auto property losses as reported by Property Claims Services.Collateral for the transaction will be invested in highly rated U.S. Treasury money market funds. The deal can be extended for loss reporting purposes by up to 18 months for losses to fully develop.Update: Mariah Re Ltd. Series 2010-1 was triggered by the record breaking tornado season in the U.S. during 2011. The total covered loss estimate rose to $836.6m at the 31st October 2011, meaning that investors in this Mariah Re deal were facing at least an $11.6m loss of principal. Loss estimates are still likely to rise further meaning further principal losses were likely.The Mariah Re Ltd. Series 2010-2 transaction which provided a lower layer of cover was a total loss.Update 2: On the 28th November 2011 it was reported that payout factors for one of the covered loss events, Catastrophe Series 42, were changed as it was discovered that it impacted the Kansas metropolitan areas (so changed the payout factor to metro from non-metro).This resulted in a jump of around $118m in the loss from this particular covered event, bringing total covered losses under the terms of Mariah Re Series 2010-1 to $954.6m.So as the attachment point was $825m and the exhaustion point was $925m for this cat bond, this means that covered losses now exceed the exhaustion point by $29.6m and so the investors in this deal have lost 100% of their principal.Update July 2013: The Mariah Re Ltd. cat bond payout is being disputed and the case has gone to litigation. The law suit claims that the reporting on events, upgrading catastrophes from non-metro to metro classification, was unorthodox and so a legal claim has been filed.

Both tranches were scheduled to mature in January 2014.The Series I issuance in November 2009 saw $75m of mortality-linked notes issued to cover U.S. and UK mortality risk.

For the series III notes to be triggered, the reference mortality index would need to jump by over 5% for the U.S. and by at least 7.5% for Japan over any two consecutive-year measurement periods during the covered period. For the series IV notes , the reference mortality indices would have to increase by at least 10% for Germany and 11.5% for Canada.Risk Management Solutions performed the risk modelling for this transaction using a range of their models including terrorism, disaster and infectious disease models.The transaction provides Swiss Re with risk protection through to the last quarter of 2014.Update: (28th December 2012)Swiss Re chose to redeem the Series 1 and Series 2 tranches of notes a year early. All of Swiss Re’s Vita Capital mortality insurance-linked security transactions contain a clause allowing them to redeem the notes earlier than the scheduled maturity, but only within the last year of the deal.Swiss Re Capital Markets told us that they exercised the early redemption feature and this includes them paying a ‘call premium’ to investors.

That should help attract investors looking to diversify their hurricane risks away from the southern states.Collateral for the deal will be invested in Treasury money market funds which are stable and have a high rating.Update:Travelers said in an annual report published in May 2012 that when the Longpoint Re II cat bond was reset using the latest version of the model it is estimated that it will increase their attachment point by around 70%, quite a jump. When Longpoint Re II came to market it had an attachment point of $2.25 billion of index-based losses.

There is also an opton extend the transaction by a further 24 months should Allianz ART choose to.The Blue Coast deal provides cover to Allianz ART against one or more hurricanes affecting the coastal states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. Most of the risk sits in Florida as it features the highest notional loss by counties.This innovative deal has a slightly different trigger mechanism to the norm. The default trigger is an industry loss warranty of state level loss estimates reported by Property Claims Services. The innovative bit is that losses are allocated down to a county level thus reducing the basis-risk to Allianz ART without needing an indemnity trigger.
The deal is structured in three tranches of Class A, B and C notes with additonal layers of retention.There is a low and high trigger threshold for each county, which again helps reduce basis risk. Should losses go above either or both triggers then initially the notional payout will contribute to eroding the $170m retention layer. Once the retention is eroded the losses will attach to each layer of notes in turn.This deal has a low probability of attachment and since 1900 there have only been 10 risk periods (equal to 2.9 hurricane seasons) where losses were severe enough to trigger a loss to at least one layer of notes.The notes have received ratings of BB-, B+ and B from Standard & Poor’s.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

That seems risky to us as the probability of two or more major casualty events occurring in a three year period must be reasonably high.Also, we believe that Avalon Re cuts across many types of risk, including some liability type risks which could be the kind which develop losses slowly, this adds risk to investors.It may be that Avalon Re, while a poster child for a new casualty cat bond class, might end up looked back on as rather rudimentary. We hope that isn’t the case, but it does seem to us that a little more strategic selection of the types of risk to include would have gone a long way.Update:Avalon Re has since been held up as an example of a catastrophe bond structure which was not well thought through as the development time for losses meant that it has taken years for the eventual fate of the deal to be understood.As expected, the deal has now officially defaulted and had to make a loss payment for the amount of $12.69m.Losses from the covered events totalled $314.1m ($297m from the Buncefield oil depot explosion and $17.1m from the New York steam pipe explosion), Avalon Re covered 90% of the losses in excess of a $300m attachment point and so the holders of Class C notes will be liable for the excess losses. Class C’s balance was $135m and that is now reduced by the $12.69m.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.

The index is based on recorded windspeeds, and is weighted to match the regional variations in vulnerability to wind-related damage for the protected network.The bond uses a parametric trigger, meaning that the bond’s payout will not match EdF’s exposure or losses exactly. Instead, it is triggered when wind speeds across France exceed certain levels according to the index. The index is weighted to reflect EdF’s exposure across the country. The index is weighted most heavily towards the south-west of the country and is based on data provided by Météo-France, the French meteorological office.This €190m (US$228m) five-year deal has two tranches. The first, worth Eu120m, will pay out the first time the index is triggered. Investors will then lose their capital according to a sliding scale depending on the severity of the storms. This tranche is rated Ba1 by Moody’s, BB+ by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and has an expected loss of 54 basis points (bp).

If the tournament is canceled because of terrorism risk, the bond will pay out, a spokesman for Zurich-based FIFA said. In the event of cancellation, investors will lose 75% of their money invested in the bonds.FIFA conscientiously opted for this arrangement having carefully evaluated the traditional insurance market, which no longer covers FIFAs needs as required. As a result of the attacks in the USA on 11 September 2001 and the subsequent withdrawal by insurers from the 2002 FIFA World Cup cancellation insurance policy, FIFA requires any future protection to be immune from such risk. The proposed transaction meets FIFAs requirements in this respect.This transaction is said to be the first to transfer event risk (the risk of a sporting event being cancelled) and the first to transfer the risk of man-made catastrophe as well as natural catastrophe to the capital markets. The bond was rated A3, or mid-investment grade by ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service. It came in four tranches denominated in three currencies via a special purpose vehicle called Golden Goal Finance Limited.RMS performed risk analysis which examined the threat and impact of terrorism events and natural disasters on the 64-match FIFA World Cup final competition.

George Town Re did not provide a coupon to investors, rather it distributed available net income to them.It was calculated using a combination of the total net premium income available to the vehicle and the return made on securities investments.The George Town Re catastrophe bond paid out roughly $0.5m to the sponsor after it suffered some losses due to a range of catastrophic events, including Hurricane Floyd, Windstorms Anatol, Lothar and Martin, the 2000 UK Floods, and the 2001 attack on the World Trade Centre.Register today for ILS Asia 2023, our next insurance-linked securities (ILS) market conference.
